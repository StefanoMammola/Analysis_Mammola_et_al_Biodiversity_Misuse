This paper is an introduction to and overview of a special issue on groundwater ecology with a focus on biodiversity assessment and conservation. The subterranean environment harbours unique biological communities of remarkable diversity, comprising both microorganisms and micro-, meio- and macrofauna. This biodiversity of ground waters remains poorly known compared to that of freshwater surface habitats. 2. The papers in this special issue summarise the outcome of a large-scale European survey, the PASCALIS project (Protocol for the ASsessment and Conservation of Aquatic Life In the Subsurface), complemented by results from a few other comprehensive studies on groundwater diversity. The papers fall into five broad groups. The first group reviews the biology and ecology of poorly investigated but important subterranean taxa such as Bacteria and Archaea, Oligochaeta and Copepoda. Five papers deal with groundwater biodiversity patterns in the six selected PASCALIS regions. Issues addressed range from broad-scale diversity patterns to partitioning of species richness, cryptic diversity, sampling methodology, and the use of surrogate taxonomic groups for assessing overall diversity. Four papers analyse biodiversity patterns in single European regions, the French Jura, the Walloon region of Belgium, the Lessinian Mountains of Italy and south-western Germany. Two additional papers address the issue of site selection for the conservation and protection of groundwater species, and the fifth group of three papers expands two central PASCALIS themes - sampling adequacy and the role of dispersal. Finally, a concluding synthesis paper summarises advances in understanding groundwater biodiversity patters and conservation and points out important challenges for future research. 3. Collectively, the information presented in this special issue represents the first broad-scale examination of aquatic subterranean diversity based on a rigorously standardised sampling protocol, the first examination of stygofauna patterns in both karstic and non-karstic aquifers, a first step toward integrating traditional and molecular taxonomic studies of groundwater biodiversity, and a start toward elaborating strategies for groundwater reserve selection.

Biomass of heterotrophic bacteria sometimes predominates total heterotrophic biomass in lakes, and organic matter transfer started from heterotrophic bacteria has been intensively studied by numerous researchers all over the world. The roles of planktonic protists, such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates, in microbial loop are to consume bacteria that are too small to serve directly as major prey items for most zooplankters, and to be themselves utilized by the zooplankton. There is a consensus that food linkages between bacteria and protists are substantial in many lakes. In addition, bacterial loss due to viral lysis has also been paid great attention by many researchers since the late 1990. The present review provides the overview on the trend and future stage of microbial loop researches in freshwater systems, with special reference to culture-independent molecular techniques such as PCR cloning and sequencing, fluorescently in situ hybridization or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for phylogenetic analyses on microbial communities. A review on ecology and biodiversity researches on microbial loop in Lake Biwa is also provided."

This can lead to different, sometimes contradictory, outcomes of conservation. We studied local perceptions of ecosystem service flows in the Ranomafana National Park area of Madagascar to examine the local outcomes of conservation. The Ranomafana forest area provides a variety of benefits that contribute considerably to local inhabitants' livelihoods and well-being. Changes in ecosystem service flows alter the provision of many important ecosystem services at the local level, which is likely to affect local livelihoods negatively and increase local vulnerability and inequality. The findings indicate the presence of trade-offs between types of ecosystem services and between different societal goals, namely conservation and development. Benefit trade-offs also occur within and between beneficiary groups and across spatial and temporal scales. Although conservation might prove beneficial for local people in the long run, its immediate local costs are high. The findings reveal the importance of integrating local perceptions of ecosystem services into conservation planning. In addition, there is a need for further negotiations of the trade-offs between ecosystem services, conservation and development in Ranomafana. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Less attention has been paid to the study of hard bottom organisms settling on both natural and artificial substrates usually present within the basins and often constituting peculiar communities. The ecological role of such communities is remarkable, since they often reach high values of species richness and include bioconstructor organisms able to build true reefs. These reefs can strongly impact the environment, improving biodiversity through the increase of spatial heterogeneity. The present work aims to supplement new faunistic data on five lagoon systems of the south-eastern Italian coast, integrating the still fragmentary knowledge of their macrozoobenthos through the study of hard substrate communities. Sampling was performed on hard substrates colonized by complex benthic communities. The assemblages recorded were then compared in the light of the study sites' main ecological traits. Our data highlighted the occurrence of a rich benthic macrofauna, with 100 taxa found. This markedly increases the value of species richness reported in the literature for the macrozoobenthos of the study sites. In particular, the species list provided for the Ugento Basins was the first ever compiled for this site. In spite of their geographical proximity, the investigated sites, according to their diverse environmental conditions, showed substantial differences as regards their respective macrozoobenthic communities.

1436	WOS:000227647600008	Political incentives for biodiversity conservation	Conservation Biology	01/04/2005	NA	22	There seems to be a worldwide lack of political will for conservation that leads, inevitably, to an undermining of conservation policy. This is a standard complaint but one that has received little academic attention. In an attempt to better understand the gap between conservation policy and practice, we examined conservation policies and practice as they have played out in the Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh, India, over the past two decades. In particular we consider the park's experience within two larger contexts: (1) Himachal's current development orientation, which seeks to transform the state into the electrical powerhouse of the country by building over 300 medium and large power projects and (2) electoral politics that result in politician's support for villagers and others denied access to national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Each of these factors works to undermine state conservation policies. Conservationists need to build political bridges with local communities if they are to use electoral power to work for rather than against conservation. Only such electoral power can be expected to force governments to adopt more cautious policies in advancing a particular development agenda. In the absence of strategic alignments in places such as Himachal Pradesh with strong democratic traditions, one must expect continued political support for potentially destructive megaprojects and an absence of political support for the conservation of biological diversity.

To date, actions proposed by the international community to address these problems have largely been conducted in a piecemeal fashion. Conservation biologists advocate for low-intensity management in temperate protected areas to maintain and restore biodiversity. Low-input, high-diversity biomass from such areas has been proposed as a promising alternative bioenergy feedstock. Here, we show that there is a vast unexploited biomass-for-bioenergy potential present in Natura 2000, the European nature conservation network. Spanning 7.5 million hectares (ha), non-forest ecosystems within Natura 2000 have a biomass production of 17.9 teragrams (Tg) of dry matter annually. The conversion of this biomass to bioenergy will not lead to the displacement of food production systems, thereby avoiding 12.5 Tg of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions and circumventing between 1.2 and 2.8 million ha of indirect land-use change. The use of conservation biomass as bioenergy feedstock clearly offers the opportunity to reconcile biodiversity goals and climate-change mitigation.

In response to climatic changes, species around the world have already started to shift their ranges along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. However, it remains unclear whether the areas currently managed for biodiversity protection are optimized for these shifting ranges. Climate velocities represent a method to quantify the rate at which organisms must alter their range to maintain their current climate envelope. Here we use a case study of the Southern Rockies region in the western United States to show how forward and backward climate velocities can be used to quantify potential impacts of climatic changes and delineate abiotic climate refugia. We further illustrate how climate velocities can integrate into a process that simultaneously identifies climate refugia for suites of species while accounting for additional landscape factors contributing to protected area success. These results demonstrate how potential climatic changes may be used to prioritize the efficient selection of climate refugia, potentially aiding multi-target climate adaptation decision-making across broad regions.

Here, we investigated the fungal communities associated with the canopy forming macroalga Sargassum ilicifolium(Turner) C. Argardh (1820) in Singapore. We collected eight S. ilicifolium thalli from each of eight island locations and separated them into three structures-leaves, holdfast and vesicles. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and subsequent analyses revealed weak but significant differences in fungal community composition from different structures. Fungal communities were also significantly different among sampling localities, even over relatively small spatial scales (<= 12 km). Unsurprisingly, all structures from all localities were dominated by unclassified fungi. Our findings demonstrate the potential of marine environments to act as reservoirs of undocumented biodiversity that harbour many novel fungal taxa. These unclassified fungi highlight the need to look beyond terrestrial ecosystems in well-studied regions of the world, and to fully characterize fungal biodiversity in hotspots such as Southeast Asia for better understanding the roles they play in promoting and maintaining life on our planet.

We introduce plots of residuals from species-area relationships shifted upwards by the 95% confidence limits of the intercept (alpha-values) as a new tool for identifying and ranking of hotspots.

In the present study, infaunal assemblages were examined in the eastern Great Australian Bight (GAB) to evaluate the efficacy of the Benthic Protection Zone of the GAB Marine Park in representing regional biodiversity. Distributional patterns in infauna were further examined in relation to epifaunal species composition and environmental conditions to investigate structural forcing. Grab samples of infauna were collected from the same 65 sites sampled in an earlier survey of epifauna. In total, 240 taxa belonging to 11 phyla were collected. Most taxa were uncommon, with 96% representing less than 2% of the total number of individuals collected and 39% occurring at only one site. Unlike the epifauna, the infauna of the eastern GAB does not appear to be particularly diverse. Sessile filter feeders dominated the infaunal communities of the inner shelf, whereas motile, deposit-feeding organisms dominated the shelf break. As was the case with the epifauna, the highest numbers of taxa and individuals were recorded near the head of the bight and in inner-shelf waters off the western Eyre Peninsula, where productivity is enhanced by upwelling. Cluster analysis identified three community groupings, which were strongly correlated with depth. All three communities and 72% (172) of the 240 taxa collected were represented within the Benthic Protection Zone of the GAB Marine Park, confirming findings from the epifaunal survey that this protected area is well placed to represent the benthic biodiversity of the eastern GAB.

Whereas the term is hard to conceptualize in general, specific links between culture and biodiversity can be explored. In this paper, we focus on land use, which is on one hand culturally coined, and has on the other hand far-reaching impacts on biodiversity. The specific effects of land use on biodiversity depend on its intensity, which can be parameterized in different way, not the least depending on the scale of observation. Based on a short review of different approaches on how to assess land use intensity (LUI), we propose a new conceptual framework reflecting the scaled nature of the linkages between land management and biodiversity. From the plot to the landscape level, different aspects of LUI are becoming relevant, some of which we illustrate with case studies from China, Greece and Switzerland. We conclude on how the framework proposed can further our understanding on the interconnectedness of humans and their environment.

Using choice modeling, the majority of respondents to a survey on pesticide use in the environment are willing to accept an increase in the price of bread if the survival of partridge chicks and the number of wild plants increase. The study identifies the need for further empirical work with respect to methodological validation, price estimation, and the use of survey results in policy analysis. In particular, the environmental effects of pesticide use are complex and, therefore, present difficult challenges when presenting information to lay people. Forty-one percent of respondents changed their responses regarding willingness to pay more for bread when references to pesticide use were introduced in the questionnaire. This indicates that scenarios depicting changes in pesticide use can be difficult to present to lay people in an economically rational and well-defined context. Thus, in the study of valuation related to changes in pesticide use, much attention should be devoted to the design and definition of the context. Furthermore, the effects of providing different background information, e.g., with or without the mention of pesticides, should be tested.

Restoration Ecology	01/01/2010	10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00430.x	15	Revegetation of massively altered landscapes for multiple benefits (including biodiversity and ecological function) has accelerated over the past two decades in southern Australia. However, much of the action has been conducted piecemeal, with little apparent strategy. We consider here replanted woodlands on the floodplain of the Murray River, northern Victoria, Australia. All are small in area (< 18 ha) and recent (< 30 years) and have been planted with appropriate trees and shrubs. We employed a scoring system devised to rapidly measure bird breeding success and linked these results to in-site and landscape variables. Most bird species using the replantings were those that are tolerant of much disturbed landscapes and of open country. Factors related to breeding success were different for each of the six species for which inferences could be made, indicating that it would be difficult to simultaneously plan for all species. Birds characteristic of the major forest floodplain remnants were poorly represented and there was little evidence of their breeding in the replantings. The value of the replanted sites for birds is marginal at present, although it may be that the sites are still too young to have realized their usefulness for species of conservation concern. We believe that most production landscapes in this region have far too little native vegetation to support the many species that are declining, and more strategic planning is necessary to overcome these deficiencies.

Using data for over 10 000 animal species listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, we investigated taxonomic and geographic biodiversity conservation research trends worldwide. We found extreme bias in conservation research effort on threatened vertebrates compared with lesser-studied invertebrates in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats at a global scale. Based on an analysis of common threats affecting vertebrates and invertebrates, we suggest a path forward for narrowing the research gap between threatened vertebrates and invertebrates.

The empirical data was generated from personal interviews and factors influencing the respondents' choice were examined with the aid of multinomial logit model. The results showed that most of the respondents preferred an institution that has less transaction costs. Respondents' choice of biodiversity conservation institution were influenced by factors such as income from farming activities, income from non-timber forest products, and income from non-traditional employment. This study will contribute to the knowledge of natural resource management policy.	Ezebilo, E.

6048	WOS:000086270100005	The biodiversity crisis and adaptation to climate change: A case study from Australia's forests	Environmental Monitoring and Assessment	01/03/2000	NA	6	If current trends continue, human activities will drastically alter most of the planet's remaining natural ecosystems and their composite biota within a few decades. Compounding the impacts on biodiversity from deleterious management practices is climate variability and change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that there is ample evidence to suggest climate change is likely to result in significant impacts on biological diversity. These impacts are likely to be exacerbated by the secondary effects of climate change such as changes in the occurrence of wildfire, insect outbreaks and similar disturbances. Current changes in climate are very different from those of the past due to their rate and magnitude, the direct effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and because highly modified landscapes and an array of threatening processes limit the ability of terrestrial ecosystems and species to respond to changed conditions. One of the primary human adaptation option for conserving biodiversity is considered to be changes in management. The complex and overarching nature of climate change issues emphasises the need for greatly enhanced cooperation between scientists, policy makers, industry and the community to better understand key interaction's and identify options for adaptation. A key challenge is to identify opportunities that facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing technologies and developing policies that enhance the resilience of climate-sensitive sectors. Measures to enhance the resilience of biodiversity must be considered in all of these activities if many ecosystem services essential to humanity are to be sustained. New institutional arrangements appear necessary at the regional and national level to ensure that policy initiatives and research directed at assessing and mitigating the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change are complementary and undertaken strategically and cost-effectively. Policy implementation at the national level to meet responsibilities arising from the UNFCCC (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol) and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity require greater coordination and integration between economic sectors, since many primary drivers of biodiversity loss and vulnerability are influenced at this level. A case study from the Australian continent is used to illustrate several key issues and discuss a basis for reform, including recommendations for facilitating adaptation to climate variability and change.

However, to meet societal demands for predicting changes in ecosystem services, the functional and structural view dominating these two branches of ecology, respectively, must be integrated. Biodiversity-ecosystem function research has addressed this integration for two decades, but full integration that makes predictions relevant to practical problems is still lacking. We argue that full integration requires going, in both branches, deeper by taking into account individual organisms and the evolutionary and physico-chemical principles that drive their behavior. Individual-based models are a major tool for this integration. They have matured by using individual-level mechanism to replace the demographic thinking which dominates classical theoretical ecology. Existing individual-based ecosystem models already have proven useful both for theory and application. Still, next-generation individual-based models will increasingly use standardized and re-usable submodels to represent behaviors and mechanisms such as growth, uptake of nutrients, foraging, and home range behavior. The strategy of pattern-oriented modeling then helps make such ecosystem models structurally realistic by developing theory for individual behaviors just detailed enough to reproduce and explain patterns observed at the system level. Next-generation ecosystem scientists should include the individual-based approach in their toolkit and focus on addressing real systems because theory development and solving applied problems go hand-in-hand in individual-based ecology.

7653	WOS:000221906700008	Topographic controls on the regional-scale biodiversity of the south-western USA	Journal of Biogeography	01/07/2004	NA	94	Aim Topography is a fundamental geophysical observable that contains valuable information about the geodynamic, tectonic and climatic history of a region. Here, we extend the traditional uses of topographic analysis to evaluate the role played by topography in the distribution of regional-scale biodiversity in the south-western USA. An important aspect of our study is its ability to provide a way to quantify characteristics of the topographic fabric and to construct predictive models that can be used to test hypotheses that relate topography and biodiversity. Location South-western USA region of the North American Cordillera. Methods Our approach begins with a quantitative analysis of the topography and the construction of a predicted biodiversity map based on measurable topographic quantities: organization, roughness, slope aspect, grain orientation and mean elevation. We then make a quantitative comparison between the predicted and observed biodiversity, based on the assumption that land-cover diversity is a plausible measure of regional-scale biodiversity. Land-cover information used for this study was collected as part of the U.S.G.S. global land cover characteristics (GLCC) project and is derived from satellite (AVHRR) imagery. Results To a first order, the predicted regional-scale biodiversity based on our topographic model shows a good correlation with the observed biodiversity (as estimated from the land-cover diversity). Our model overestimates the biodiversity in many parts of the Colorado Plateau, Rio Grande Rift, and the low desert regions of the Southern Basin and Range, suggesting that in these provinces a biodiversity estimate based solely on topography is an over-simplification. However, much of the Madrean Archipelago and Sierra Madre provinces, which are centres of high biodiversity in this region, show excellent agreement between the observed and predicted biodiversity. Main conclusions While we acknowledge that many other factors in addition to topography have an important influence on biodiversity (particularly on a local scale), we conclude that topography plays a primary role in the regional to continental-scale biodiversity, particularly in regions characterized by insular mountain fabrics.

8207	WOS:000267234500008	Modern deep-sea benthic foraminifera: a brief review of their morphology-based biodiversity and trophic diversity	Biogeochemical Controls on Palaeoceanographic Environmental Proxies	01/01/2008	10.1144/SP303.8	50	Most fossil deep-sea foraminifera are multichambered and have relatively robust, calcareous or agglutinated shells. Modem assemblages, on the other hand, include many fragile monothalamous (single-chambered) forms and komokiaceans (a superfamily of protist currently placed within the foraminifera) with soft test walls. These groups are poorly known and most of the hundreds of morphospecies recognized in deep-sea samples are undescribed. The relative abundance of robust and fragile taxa varies with water depth and food supply. Calcareous and other hard-shelled species tend to predominate in relatively eutrophic areas, particularly on continental margins, but decrease as a proportion of the 'entire' live fauna (i.e. including soft-shelled species) with increasing water depth, even above the CCD (carbonate compensation depth). Most of the species on which the foraminiferal proxies used in palaeoceanography are based live in these bathyal regions. At abyssal depths, and particularly below the CCD, faunas are largely agglutinated and dominated by monothalamous forms. These assemblages have a much lower fossilization potential than those found on continental margins. In addition to carbonate dissolution, these patterns probably reflect adaptations to increasingly oligotrophic conditions on the ocean floor with increasing depth and distance from land. Bathyal species include herbivores and opportunistic deposit feeders (omnivores) that consume labile organic material, in addition to deep-infaunal deposit feeders, and must contribute significantly to carbon cycling. Many abyssal monothalamous foraminifera, in constrast, accumulate stercomata (waste pellets composed of fine sediment particles) and probably ingest sediment, associated bacteria and more refractory organic matter. Some monothalamous species without stercomata may be bacteriovores. Although they probably process organic carbon at a slower rate than calcareous species. the shear abundance of monothalamous taxa at abyssal depths suggests that they are important in carbon cycling on a global scale. The loss of a substantial proportion of foraminiferal biomass and biodiversity from the fossil record should be considered when using foraminifera to reconstruct palaeoproductivity, for example, by using the Benthic Foraminiferal Accummulation Rate (BFAR). Different dietary preferences among calcareous species have implications for the stable carbon isotope signal preserved in their shells.	Gooday, A.

The Ascomycota was the dominant phylum in both composts (90 % of all sequences recovered) with the thermophilic-rich orders Sordariales and Eurotiales being the most numerous. Molecular studies demonstrated the frequent presence of several thermophilic (Scytalidium thermophilum, Myriococcum thermophilum) and thermotolerant (Pseudallescheria boydii, Corynascus verrucosus and Coprinopsis sp.) fungi in the composts, despite the absence of these species from the culture-based analysis. Conversely, Aspergillus fumigatus and Mycocladus corymbifer, which were the dominant species in cultivation analyses, had very low representation in molecular studies. The results show that the previous picture of the dominant thermophilous fungi in compost communities derived from culture-based analysis has been biased, and that composting environments represent a potentially rich resource of novel fungi.

They have traditionally played an important role in agriculture and horticulture, in the production of firewood, and as windbreaks, boundaries, and screens. Through this investigation of a suburban Satoyama landscape in western Japan, which includes old and new residential areas, public space, farmland, and abandoned land, we aimed to show how isolated trees and hedges are connected with local traditional cultural features, and how this link has impacted their distribution and species composition. By examining land categories, shape patterns, and species compositions of isolated trees and hedges in both traditional and newly developed regions of the study area, we showed how the presence or absence of related traditional cultural features has influenced biodiversity. We further examined the role of traditional management techniques and cultural features in maintaining high numbers of local native species in isolated trees and hedges. Based on our results, we argue that awareness and promotion of the biocultural link in isolated trees and hedges will play an important role in future efforts to preserve the unique local identity and biodiversity of this cultural landscape."

10071	WOS:000183770600002	Origins of European biodiversity: palaeo-geographic signification of peat inception during the Holocene in the granitic eastern Massif Central (France)	Landscape Ecology	01/04/2003	NA	17	Mires are rare, unique environments that greatly contribute to biodiversity and occupy key functions in the hydrological cycle, but today many of these ecosystems are menaced, making conservation measures necessary. The efficiency of these measures is partly related to our knowledge of their origins and their development, a question rarely addressed. In this paper we examine the development of mires during the 10.000 last years (Holocene) in the eastern Massif Central, France, focusing on the contributions of climate change and human activities. Radiocarbon dates of the basal layers of 63 sites show that many mires formed around 7500 BP. During the Holocene, many mires were formed in the Atlantic period, characterised by warmer and wetter climatic conditions. At shorter time scales of 10(3) - 10(2) years, several other factors are related to peat inception, including topography, geomorphology and superficial geology, vegetation successions and human-induced changes. There is evidence that the building of small dams in headwater streams during the Iron age induced local water logging which then lead to the initiation and growth of mires. The influence of Bronze age communities is further demonstrated by new pollen analysis results. Forest clearing and grazing also favoured soil water logging, enabling peat inception. We consider human societies to be responsible for the formation of some mires. Human activities can be considered to having taken part in the development of the European biodiversity at least during the last 5 millennium.

Consequently, little is currently known about deep-ocean biodiversity in the TER An enriched understanding of biogeographic patterns and the factors that influence them is crucial to the success of efforts to conserve deep-sea communities. The objectives of this research were to provide the first assessment of biodiversity and community composition of bathyal demersal (200 - 3,000 m) fauna across multiple ocean/island archipelagos in the TEP. To better understand biodiversity and its drivers in the region, we tested the hypotheses that biodiversity and faunal assemblage composition vary with location and environmental drivers (e.g., bathymetry, oxygen concentration). Using Deep-Ocean Dropcams, we collected video footage from Clipperton, Galapagos, Revillagigedo, and Malpelo oceanic islands, in depths ranging from 200 to 3,000 m. Taxa richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were calculated for each location. In general, biodiversity values were high closer to the equator and closer to the continent, and low in the locations farther north and farther west. Fish family biodiversity was highest in the Galapagos, followed by Malpelo. In contrast, Clipperton had significantly lower fish family richness compared to all other locations. For invertebrate orders, Revillagigedo was significantly lower in biodiversity compared to the Galapagos and Malpelo. Broad-scale Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) and dissolved oxygen had a positive effect on fish diversity metrics. Both fish and invertebrate assemblages were significantly different among locations. Around each of the island groups are vastly different current patterns, which likely accounts for some of the variation we observed in biodiversity and community composition. Due to the longitudinal East Pacific Rise, which limits population connectivity by creating a spatial barrier to gene flow and dispersal among marine organisms, the TEP is largely isolated from the wider Pacific. The islands and archipelagos likely represent important stepping-stones and corridors for species connectivity across the TEP and the wider Pacific. Therefore, the preservation of these intact ecosystems is crucial for maintaining biodiversity both within the TEP as well as across the wider Pacific region.

On the northern coast of Mindoro, here focusing on the municipality of Abra de Ilog, an apparent contradiction lies in the fact that the number of families of coral and fish, and corresponding species counts, remains relatively high, though coral cover is ""fair to good"" at best due to various sources of anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, the mean catch per unit effort (0.92 kg/person/hour) and the mean income per unit effort (PhP33.3 [USD 0.70]/person/hour) are both low, with 23% of total fishing trips reporting no catch.

We investigated benthic invertebrate communities at 103 sites in braided channels, springs and hillslope streams in the Waimakariri River, New Zealand over 3 months. One hundred taxa were identified, including a number of rare phreatic species. Highest total taxonomic richness occurred in springs (81 taxa), whereas main braids and hillslope streams had fewer taxa (54 and 56, respectively). Spring-fed habitats also had the highest diversity of unique taxa (22), whereas main channels had five and hillslope streams 11 taxa, respectively. Several taxa including the mayfly Deleatidium and orthoclad chironomids were ubiquitous, whereas others such as the flatworm Prorhynchus had restricted habitats. Our results highlight the high spatial heterogeneity of braided river habitats and the importance of springs as centres of invertebrate diversity within braided river catchments.

The study presents collection of up to date publications on biodiversity of Kosovo. Of course, there is still to be investigated particularly in the field of lower plants as well invertebrate fauna species. Beside the small territory of 10,887 km(2), Kosovo is quite rich in both plant and animal biodiversity. Up to date 1800 vascular plant species have been recorded, while expected number is about 2500 species. Number of higher vertebrates is 210, while the invertebrates are not studied with exception of Lepidoptera with about 150 species. There is no Red List of species for Kosovo developed yet, while some short term conservation measures have already taken place.

We tested the hypothesis that recent (between 1990 and 2000) population increases may result in increased threats to biodiversity. GIS data were compiled from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, BirdLife, and the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. Polygon data sets were transformed into rasters with different resolutions from 2.5 to 1 Relationships between species diversity were assessed globally and separately for terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) and for five countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). The number of species within a 20 km-cell varied greatly and reached a maximum of 801. The species-rich cells ( species) were located in a single, almost continuous area across Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and South China. The relationship between vertebrate biodiversity and population density showed that biodiversity increased with HPD until around 10 persons km then decreased until around 200 persons km where it stabilized. This relationship was mediated by land cover and protection status with significant interactions between these variables and with population density. The areas with moderately increasing populations between 1990 and 2000 were those with the highest overall diversity (median 607) whereas those with decreasing populations were those with the lowest diversity (median 479). Our results suggest that population pressure on biodiversity has increased between 1990 and 2000 and this is a relatively widespread phenomenon. The presence of a continuous area of high vertebrate biodiversity calls for international action at a regional scale involving China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Because of this, there is an urgent need to identify the factors leading to collision hotspots and thus implementing effective mitigation measures. By using a stratified random sampling survey, we investigated the fine-scale determinants of roadkill probability in small and medium-sized birds and mammals across a country-size region of Southern Spain, Andalusia (87,000 km(2)), located within a global biodiversity hotspot. During two consecutive seasons, we regularly surveyed 45 road transects of 10 km each and characterized the site-specific attributes of both roadkill and random points, including traffic density, road design (embankments, medians, fences, roadside vegetation and distance to curves), and adjacent landscape matrix. Based on this information, we investigated variation in collision risk according to landscape and road features, and the life history of the affected taxa. Mortality rates of mammals and birds increased with traffic density, and were also significantly affected by the distance to the nearest curve, slope of embankments, height of roadside vegetation, and land use adjacent to roads. Road mortality of both birds and mammals was related to the presence and typology of fences and center medians, so more densely vegetated medians and smaller mesh sizes reduced roadkill probability. Overall, our results indicate that roadkill risk may vary at exceedingly small spatial scales. The information provided by this extensive survey may be used to identify taxa-specific factors associated to roadkill risk and priority points for action. Our findings will therefore be relevant for the design of safer roads for both drivers and wildlife through the application of effective mitigation measures.

3577	WOS:000285326400015	A GIS Based Assessment Tool for Biodiversity Conservation	International Journal of Environmental Research	01/09/2010	NA	11	Infrastructure development often leads to considerable changes in the land use. These changes are major causes of habitat fragmentation and ecosystem loss. Moreover, decrease of the environmental impacts on biodiversity is among the most important objectives of sustainable development. For this purpose, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) along with the other appropriate tools can be applied to identify and predict the magnitude of such problems. Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) as a specific disciplinary tool could be useful to identify the actual impacts on biodiversity within Environmental Impact Assessment. This tool with the assistance of Geographic Information system (GIS) techniques evaluates the data in a comprehensible way. In this paper, a brief case study dealing with the assessment of road alternatives has been carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of BIA. It is found that according to vegetation and wildlife maps, ecosystem loss and fragmentation score of proposed road are more than the existing one. On the basis of the assessment results, the authors also stated that application of BIA in Iran with an exclusive biodiversity is essentially needed.	Monavari, S.

The experimental design consisted of three tiers of small plastic pools arranged at increasing distances from the shore. As a result of community development over six months (January to June 1997) we observed considerable differentiation of physical conditions among replicate habitats at the benign end of the physical gradient, with a concurrent increase in biodiversity (species richness per habitat unit). The most probable explanation for this observed gradient is self-generated habitat heterogeneity that, in turn, promotes biodiversity, likely through species interactions. Using additional analyses, including randomization techniques, we excluded the effects of sample size and external factors as sources for the observed increase in biodiversity in the third tier (furthest from the sea). We interpret this result as evidence for the complex causal relationship among physical stress, habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity.

These alterations threaten the biodiversity of floodplains. While the effects of individual factors on plant species composition and diversity in riparian systems have been frequently studied, it is yet unknown how multiple stressors act in concert and whether the effects remain visible across regions. We chose the floodplains of German Federal Waterways (rivers with a high frequency of shipping traffic) to study the main drivers of plant species composition and biodiversity along heavily modified rivers and aimed to show whether natural differences obscure the effects of human alterations. We recorded the vegetation of river banks, grassland, and alluvial forest fragments in 20 study sites distributed across Germany. Species composition differed from natural floodplain alliances and showed a trend towards terrestrialization and an increase of common species that show no specific preference for floodplain habitats. Despite natural differences such as topography and climate having the strongest influence on plant composition and diversity, the effects of anthropogenic influence (e.g. land use, shipping traffic) remained visible. River construction tended to increase species diversity since the terrestrial species pool is bigger than the one of floodplain specialists. For restoration and ecological river management not only species numbers but their composition and ecological specifics should be considered, and local conditions need to be taken into account.

4710	WOS:000178153900021	Biodiversity, invasion resistance, and marine ecosystem function: Reconciling pattern and process	Ecology	01/09/2002	NA	388	A venerable generalization about community resistance to invasions is that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, a well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, We limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function. In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native-species richness and the number and frequency of normative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 X 25 cm), and an entire site (50 X 50 in). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field. Further synthesis of mechanistic and observational approaches should be encouraged, as this will increase our understanding of the conditions under which diversity does (and does not) play an important role in determining the distribution of invaders in the field.

4997	WOS:000185073100024	Indo-Pacific biodiversity of coral reefs: Deviations from a mid-domain model	Ecology	01/08/2003	NA	156	Understanding the nature and causes of global gradients in species richness is a perennial ecological problem, and recent work has highlighted the need to assess these gradients relative to an appropriate statistical expectation. This paper examines latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richnesses of corals and reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific domain and compares them with gradients predicted by a mid-domain model in which geographic domains are located at random between the latitudinal and longitudinal boundaries-of this region. We test for significant differences between observed and predicted species-richness patterns, and we identify regions that are enriched or depauperate in species, relative to expectation. In addition, we move beyond previous mid-domain analyses by directly comparing observed spatial distributions of geographic ranges with those predicted by a mid-domain model. This comparison indicates precisely how species-richness anomalies are produced by nonrandomness in the distribution of species ranges. For both corals and fishes, large and statistically significant differences exist between observed latitudinal and longitudinal species-richness gradients and those predicted by mid-domain models. Longitudinally, species richness is markedly higher than predicted along the African coast and, to a lesser extent, within the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and it is markedly lower than expected in the eastern Pacific. Latitudinally, species richness becomes increasingly higher than predicted as one moves from the equator to the tropical margins; then it becomes sharply lower than predicted beyond the tropics. Unexpectedly, differences between observed and predicted spatial distributions of range endpoints and midpoints reveal a pattern of nonrandomness that is highly congruent with the hypothesis that gyres in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the IAA forming a porous boundary between them, have a-major influence on Indo-Pacific species-richness patterns. Our analyses indicate that the perspective offered by a focus on explaining nonrandomness in the location of geographic ranges (rather than explaining why species, numbers vary in space) is likely to dramatically alter our assessments of alternative explanations for global species-richness gradients.

The changes in community characteristics along the gradients of water, heat and altitude, and community edge effects were also considered in this paper. The results showed that the main plants among the three plots were Gramineae, Compositae, Chenopodiaceae and Rosacea, which accounted for 30.0%, 20.0%, 13.3% and 10.0% of the total. There were Artemisia frigid and Carex duriuscula in every plot, which indicated that the three plots were experiencing different degrees of degradation. From the typical steppe to the Mongolica forest-steppe ecotone to the mongolica forest steppe, the cumulative dominance of every type of shrub, sub shrub and perennial grass decreased in order, with a significant difference (p < 0.05). The cumulative dominance of perennial forbs, however, was an increasing trend, and the cumulative dominance of annual herbaceous plants in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone was the highest. The biomass of shrubs, sub shrubs and perennial grasses, and the total biomass of communities, decreased successively among the three plots, and the difference was significant. The biomass of perennial forbs in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone was significantly lower than that observed in the typical steppe and the mongolica forest steppe. The annual herbaceous biomass was low in every plot, but clearly the highest in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone. The Patrick richness index (P-a), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (II) and Pielou evenness index decreased successively among the three plots.

6807	WOS:000588022500001	Disrupting the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function Relationship: Response of Shredders and Leaf Breakdown to Urbanization in Andean Streams	Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution	28/10/2020	10.3389/fevo.2020.592404	1	Urbanization is a major driver of stream ecosystem impairment and is typically associated with multiple stressors and species loss. A challenge is to understand how those stressors alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (B-EF). Amongst the Andean streams of southern Ecuador, we assessed the response of shredder diversity and organic matter breakdown (OMB) to urbanization and identified the urban-associated stressors disrupting the B-EF relationship. A leaf-litter bag experiment during stable flow conditions in 2016 was carried out to quantify total OMB and shredder-mediated OMB, which was estimated to represent the B-EF relationship. We calculated the taxonomic and functional diversity of shredder invertebrates associated with leaf packs. Also, a suite of physicochemical and habitat stressors was measured weekly during the field experiment. Along with the urbanization gradient, both taxonomic and functional diversity of shredders declined while OMB rates decreased. Shredders were absent and their contribution to OMB was null at the most urbanized sites. The B-EF relationship was interrupted through nutrient enrichment, physical habitat homogenization, riparian vegetation disturbance, and leaf-litter availability as a consequence of urbanization. Our results demonstrate how species loss spreads to and affects ecosystem functions in urbanized streams and how environmental stressors alter the B-EF relationship. Better land-use practices are crucial in Andean catchments to guarantee ecosystem services which are the result of successful B-EF relationships.

Using a manipulative experiment, we assessed spatial variation in patch-scale effects of complexity on intertidal biodiversity. Location 27 sites within 14 estuaries/bays distributed globally. Time period 2015-2017. Major taxa studied Functional groups of algae, sessile and mobile invertebrates. Methods Concrete tiles of differing complexity (flat; 2.5-cm or 5-cm complex) were affixed at low-high intertidal elevation on coastal defence structures, and the richness and abundance of the colonizing taxa were quantified after 12 months. Results The patch-scale effects of complexity varied spatially and among functional groups. Complexity had neutral to positive effects on total, invertebrate and algal taxa richness, and invertebrate abundances. However, effects on the abundance of algae ranged from positive to negative, depending on location and functional group. The tidal elevation at which tiles were placed accounted for some variation. The total and invertebrate richness were greater at low or mid than at high intertidal elevations. Latitude was also an important source of spatial variation, with the effects of complexity on total richness and mobile mollusc abundance greatest at lower latitudes, whilst the cover of sessile invertebrates and sessile molluscs responded most strongly to complexity at higher latitudes. Conclusions After 12 months, patch-scale relationships between biodiversity and habitat complexity were not universally positive. Instead, the relationship varied among functional groups and according to local abiotic and biotic conditions. This result challenges the assumption that effects of complexity on biodiversity are universally positive. The variable effect of complexity has ramifications for community and applied ecology, including eco-engineering and restoration that seek to bolster biodiversity through the addition of complexity.

Financial incentives can stimulate local people to participate in biodiversity conservation. A common approach to derive financial compensation is estimating the opportunity costs arising from the adoption of conservation friendly land-use practices. Assuming that farmers are risk averse, we used a decision-making under uncertainty approach to derive financial compensation for local people living in and around Ba Be National Park, Vietnam. Moderately risk-averse farmers need US$ 228 ha(-1) year(-1) financial compensation for the protection of natural forests in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones, whereas the required compensation reaches US$ 334 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone. These compensation payments were derived by comparing financial returns from natural forests with those of the most profitable land use (maize). Compensation amounts decrease to US$ 130 ha-(1) year(-1) in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones and to US$ 218 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone, when considering diversification strategy. Derived financial compensations assume that farms comprise 20% croplands and 80% forest. We conclude that compensation amounts vary with farmers' risk preferences, whether or not diversification strategy is considered, and the level of protection of a given area. 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The number of species was positively correlated with the number of specimens per site, with sites nearest Mobile Bay having fewer species, possibly reflecting higher salinities. Odonate assemblages in large flows of the Delta are unpredictable in terms of species co-occurrence, and fit a model of non-equilibrium community structure.

By examining specimens of Rosa and Cotoneaster species collected since 1920s in Hengduan Mountains, we analyzed the changes of flowering phenology and flower size in the past century when climate changes were considered to be intensified. We found that flowering phenology of Rosa showed no significant change, but flowering phenology of Cotoneaster was delayed in recent years. Flower size of Rosa species showed a marginally significant decrease over the past century. The results suggested that responses of flowering time to global changes and pollinator mediated selection on floral traits might be more complex than what were expected. Our results indicated that future researches based on investigations of herbarium specimens should be carried out on multiple plant species with different flower structures and life histories to better understand the effects of climate changes on plant traits.

9868	WOS:000463857900005	From climate zone to microhabitat-environmental factors affecting the coastal distribution of tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) in the south-eastern European biodiversity hotspot	Peerj	09/04/2019	10.7717/peerj.6676	4	Background: Tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) are predatory insects usually occurring in various sandy habitats. In south-eastern Europe, especially in lowland areas located close to the sea coast, the diversity of Cicindelidae is one of the highest in the Palaearctic realm. Although previous studies conducted in different areas of the world show that many species are habitat specialists, unfortunately little is known about environmental factors affecting the diversity and distribution of tiger beetles in this region. Material and Methods: Habitat preferences for 12 tiger beetles taxa were analysed. Over 100 samples collected in eight countries located in coastal areas of the Black and Mediterranean Seas were studied, for which climate data, macrohabitat types, and soil parameters (soil humidity, salinity, pH, and structure) were investigated. Results: Most studied Cicindelidae were characterised by narrow or very narrow habitat specialisation and did not co-occur with other ones, including 11 taxa found as habitat specialists occurring only in one or two types of macrohabitat. The most eurythopic species was Calomera littoralis nemoralis which occupied four macrohabitat types. The climatic zone, altitude, and humidity were found as the most important factors in the distribution of the studied tiger beetle species. Salt marshes and sandy sea beaches were noted as the most diverse macrohabitat types. Discussion: Tiger beetle fauna of south-eastern Europe consists mainly of habitat specialists sensitive to environmental changes, which makes these beetles perfect bioindicators. Moreover, as a great number of studied Cicindelidae taxa occur in habitats which are under a significant human impact, we suggest that in the studied area the group can be successfully used as a flagship taxon for insect and nature conservation.

However, the magnitude of impact may vary across habitats, highlighting the need to account for spatial heterogeneity in assessment studies. Here we compare invertebrate community structure in three habitats (littoral, sublittoral, and profundal) of boreal lakes that suffer recurring blooms of a regionally expanding, nuisance flagellate, Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyta), with the assemblage structure in lakes were no blooms occur. We contrast community structure over a 6-year period using univariate metrics (total abundance, community evenness, species richness, and Simpson diversity) and multivariate community similarity to infer habitat-specific associations of local (alpha) diversity. We also calculated indices of multivariate dispersion to infer associations with beta diversity; i.e., whether or not habitats in bloom lakes show faunal homogenisation. Results show that the magnitude of assemblage alteration in bloom relative to bloom-free lakes varied with habitat and increased from the littoral to the profundal habitats. Littoral assemblages in bloom and bloom-free lakes shared similar alpha (taxon richness, evenness and Simpson diversity) and beta diversity characteristics, despite differing in multivariate community similarity. By contrast, alteration of assemblage structure was most severe in the profundal and manifested in reduced diversity and faunal homogenisation (i.e. decreased beta diversity) in bloom relative to bloom-free lakes. This was due to numerical dominance of the predatory phantom midge, Chaoborus flavicans, in the profundal of bloom lakes. Not only do the results highlight that spatial heterogeneity should be accounted for to assess the potential broader impact of nuisance species on biodiversity within lakes; more generally, the dominance of a single species suggests a reduced overall resilience of bloom lakes, making them more susceptible to environmental perturbation.

Bootstrap estimates of total catch per unit effort increased from 6.96 and 10.8 ind. m(-1) h(-1) in 1967 and 1970, respectively, to 583.98 ind. m(-1) h(-1) in 1998. Gear effects and an effect of gear over time accounted for 47.1% and 20% of species variability. Further significant factors were time of day and habitat, while season was not significant. A total of 43 species was collected. Including supplementary species information, a grand total of 46 species was found associated with the Great Meteor Seamount. Diversity was higher in 1967 and 1970 (Shannon's diversity: H'=2.5 and 1.6) than in 1998 (H'=0.9). Species-environment relationships are discussed in terms of a sound-scattering layer-interception hypothesis, i.e. utilisation of prey from a diurnally moving sound-scattering layer for the bentho-pelagic community. This is probably augmented by concentration effects in a circular current around the seamount (Taylor-column). Long-term changes are discussed with respect to a decrease in biodiversity due to considerable increases in Macroramphosus scolopax and Capros aper. In 1998, the increase of abundance of Trachurus picturatus and the respective decreases for genuine benthic species were likely to have been caused by a change of gear.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences	01/09/2003	10.1139/F03-081	58	The utility of single taxonomic groups as indicators of biodiversity variation in other taxa has recently gained increasing attention, but such studies on stream organisms are lacking. We studied the diversity patterns of mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and chironomid midges across 110 headwater streams in Finland. Specifically, we examined if species richness and assemblage composition showed similar variation among the taxonomic groups across environmental gradients and if a single taxon could be used as a predictor of diversity in the other groups. Species richness and composition in different taxa exhibited slightly different relationships to environmental gradients, leading to low degrees of concordance. The diversity of mayflies and chironomids showed strongest relationships with stream acidity and water colour, whereas stoneflies and caddisflies exhibited more complex correlations with geographical location and local environmental variables. The overall assemblage composition, however, exhibited significant among-taxon congruence, as shown by Mantel tests. However, even these correlations remained rather low, thus limiting their potential for conservation purposes. Overall, our results do not support the use of single taxonomic groups as indicators of insect biodiversity in headwater stream ecosystems. Alternative approaches for lotic biodiversity assessment (e.g., morphospecies, higher-taxon richness, and environmental diversity) should thus be examined in future studies.

We considered two simple proxies of species persistence: a time series of point-count data to calculate abundance and a time series of presence-absence data to calculate permanence (a measure of consistent occupancy over time). Using two 10-year intervals of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we compared the performance of each measure at predicting persistence 18 years later. For nonrare species, abundance and permanence predicted persistence similarly well. We performed complementarity-based reserve selections with data on species abundance and permanence (from 1970 to 1979) and then evaluated the effectiveness of the reserve networks at maintaining species populations and efficiency in land use (data from 1997 to 2006). Abundance proved a better predictor of future local persistence than permanence, which justifies the relatively larger financial and temporal costs of collecting a time series of point-count data to estimate abundance. If future extinction events were used as a measure of reserve-network effectiveness, the performance of abundance and permanence did not differ markedly. Nevertheless, when future abundance, which is a more sensitive measure of network effectiveness, was used, abundance was significantly better than permanence at selecting longer-term, high-quality, species-specific habitat but required larger reserves to do so.

Birds	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2001	NA	39	Human activities, such as logging, modify the forest structure and the microenvironments of the original Nothofagus forests. The aims of this work were to evaluate changes in the diversity and relative abundance of birds and to analyze their trophic relationships with insect and plant communities along the Nothofagus pumilio forest management cycle. Data was collected using a point sampling method along transects located in different forest structures during the summer season, by direct (sight) and indirect (hearing) recognition following sunrise. Bird diversity and abundance significantly varied along the forest management cycle. Seven new species appeared after harvest, but the total number did not vary by the end of the forest management cycle, and there was no significant loss of species. Bird abundance was directly related to the insect abundance and plant biomass. Relationship between groups (lower plants, monocotyledons and dicotyledonous) is also discussed. Major studies in bird ecology are necessary to develop new silvicultural alternatives based on the more sensitive species to harvest. Forest management strategies and mitigation alternatives must be incorporated into forest planning in order to maintain the original structure of bird communities and the equilibrium with other forest species.

The biodiverse tropics offer a challenge of an altogether different magnitude for hyperspatial and hyperspectral remote sensing. This paper examines issues related to hyperspatial and hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery, which constitutes one of the most potentially powerful yet underutilized sources of for tropical research on biodiversity. Hyperspatial data with their increased pixel resolution are possibly best suited at facilitating the accurate location of features such as tree canopies, but less suited to the identification of aspects such as species identity, particularly when spatial resolution becomes too fine and pixels are smaller than the size of the object (e.g., tree canopy) being identified. Hyperspectral data on the other hand, with their high spectral resolution, can be used to record information pertaining to a range of critical plant properties related to species identity, and can be very effective used for discriminating tree species in tropical forests, despite the greater complexity of such environments. There remains a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost, data coverage, and security restrictions. Stimulating discussion on the applications of this powerful, but underutilized tool by ecologists, is the first step in promoting a more extensive use of such data for ecological studies in tropical biodiversity rich areas.

Perceptions of actors in REDD+ implementation processes can guide the design of appropriate policies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Peru with actors in REDD+ working groups at the national and subnational level (n = 50) to explore how they relate REDD+ implementation to biodiversity conservation and other policy issues, and to identify the aspects of biodiversity they regard as especially important (biodiversity conservation values). Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis; actors' statements were summarised into nine policy issue categories. Issues raised often were related to governance, socioeconomic aspects and land management in REDD+ implementation (47 % of the statements). Biodiversity issues were mentioned less often (23 %). Direct synergies between REDD+ and biodiversity conservation were assumed by most actors and few concrete risks and corresponding safeguards were mentioned. Actors mentioned 177 biodiversity conservation values, which were classified into different value types. Most values were aspects of biodiversity with direct or indirect use values (68 %). Aspects which potentially provide future benefits (option values) or resilience values were mentioned less often (5 and 16 %, respectively). The opportunity to foster conservation of use values as additional benefits from REDD+ is generally recognised by the actors, but aspects of biodiversity that are important for the long-term integrity of forest ecosystems received less attention. It is thus important to push for the integration of respective safeguards in REDD+ strategies.

Over 110 million records are already being served from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, our ability to use this information effectively for ecological research, management and conservation lags behind. A solution is a web-based Geographic Information System for enabling visualization and analysis of this rapidly expanding data resource. In this paper we detail a case study system, GBIF Mapping and Analysis Portal Application (MAPA), developed for deployment at distributed database portals. Building such a system requires overcoming a series of technical and research challenges. These challenges include: assuring fast speed of access to the vast amounts of data available through these distributed biodiversity databases; developing open standards based access to suitable environmental data layers for analyzing biodiversity distribution; building suitably flexible and intuitive map interfaces for refining the scope and criteria of an analysis; and building appropriate web-services based analysis tools that are of primary importance to the ecological community and make manifest the value of online biodiversity GBIF data. After discussing how we overcome these challenges, we provide case studies showing two examples of the use of GBIF-MAPA analysis tools. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This may affect deadwood affiliate biodiversity negatively, given that stumps constitute a large proportion of the coarse deadwood in young managed forests. Spatial decision support for evaluating the integrated effects on biodiversity and production of stump harvesting is needed. We developed a spatially explicit decision support system (called MapStump-DSS), for assessment of tree stump harvesting using biodiversity and economic criteria together with different scenarios for biodiversity conservation and bioenergy market prices. Two novel key aspects of the MAPStump-DSS is that it (1) merges and utilizes georeferenced stump-level data (e.g., tree species and diameter) directly from the harvester with stand data that are increasingly available to forest managers and (2) is flexible toward incorporating both quantitative and qualitative criteria based on emerging knowledge (here biodiversity criteria) or underlying societal drivers and end-user preferences. We tested the MAPStump-DSS on a 45 ha study forest, utilizing harvester data on characteristics and geographical positions for >26,000 stumps. The MAPStump-DSS produced relevant spatially explicit information on the biodiversity and economic values of individual stumps, where amounts of ""conflict stumps"" (with both high biodiversity and economical value) increased with bioenergy price levels and strengthened biodiversity conservation measures. The MAPStump-DSS can be applied in practice for any forest site, allowing the user to examine the spatial distribution of stumps and to obtain summaries for whole forest stands. Information depicted by the MAPStump-DSS includes amounts, characteristics, biodiversity values and costs of stumps in relation to different scenarios, which also allow the user to explore and optimize biodiversity and economy trade-offs prior to stump harvest."

The cumulative effects of past development are already being felt within the Treaty 8 First Nations of the region but these effects have not been quantified from a landscape point of view. Using habitat modeling and GIS analysis the effects of 35 years of agricultural and industrial development on forest biodiversity and ecological integrity were investigated for a 410,000 ha landscape in north-eastern British Columbia. The study identified a significant increase in area impacted by developments which lead to a shift in landscape structure and significant change in forest biodiversity. Forest fragmentation and habitat loss has resulted in an increase in open, early seral and edge habitats at the expense of contiguous mature forests. The change in landscape structure resulted in a significant increase in species richness as generalist and early seral species responded positively to increases in these habitats. A significant increase in brown-headed cowbird parasitism risk was also detected. Changes in landscape structure, reduction in habitat for 22% of modeled species, increase parasitism and predation risk due to fragmentation, and increased access have resulted in a cumulative effect of recent resource development on ecological integrity that is both additive and synergistic. The propose acceleration of future development will increase the risk to maintaining the biodiversity and ecological integrity in the Peace-Moberly region of British Columbia.

The development of a Bayesian network model that examines the trade-offs between the conservation value of the landscape for a range of taxa (flora, mammals, birds and herpetofauna) and its primary production value under alternative land uses is described. The model emphasises structural diversity of vegetation and ecosystem productivity as key drivers of both biodiversity and agricultural production. Simple scenarios, used to examine the influence of different land uses on multiple components of biodiversity and agricultural productivity, demonstrated the potential for the analysis of the trade-offs associated with alternative landscape designs. The potential of the model, as a planning or policy development tool for land management agencies or regional Natural Resource Management bodies, at multiple scales, is identified.	Waters, C.

This paper empirically examines the intentions of foresters to conserve habitats beyond what is the minimum legally defined requirement when planning forestry operations: either by delineating particular habitats defined in the Finnish Forest Act completely outside the operation, despite this not being the obligation, or by delineating other valuable habitats that are not defined in the law. This type of voluntary exceeding of minimum conservation requirements is dependent on professional judgment, which is the focus of this article. The analysis applies the theory of planned behaviour, according to which intentions to behave in a particular fashion are influenced by attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived control over the behaviour. The investigation pays attention to behavioural and normative beliefs as well as other contextual factors influencing habitat delineation practice. The data consist of 311 survey responses (response rate 58%) of Finnish foresters planning forestry operations in non-industrial private forests, employed by public, private and associational organisations. The model is rather powerful in explaining intentions to exceed the minimum requirements. We find social norms to have a strong influence on delineation intentions. This effect is stronger in the case of delineation of other valuable habitats than in the more standardised delineation of legally defined habitats where the foresters have broader experience and consider themselves more autonomous. Normative beliefs relative to other foresters' expectations dominate the general subjective norm, signalling a primacy of a professional norm and the importance of peer networks. Also the general attitude has a strong influence on intentions, whereas the effect of perception of control is low. Past behaviour predicts intentions, which implies tradition and habit to have an important role in defining the way biodiversity conservation is integrated into forest management. In other words, abrupt changes are unlikely to occur in an institutionalized practice. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of policy implementation as well as governance of multiple functions of forests more generally. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Studies over time provide exceptional opportunities to detect the effects of extreme climatic events and to measure their impacts by quantifying rates of change at population and community levels. In this study, we show how an extreme storm event affected the dynamics of benthic coralligenous outcrops in the NW Mediterranean Sea using data acquired before (2006-2008) and after the impact (2009-2010) at four different sites. Storms of comparable severity have been documented to occur occasionally within periods of 50 years in the Mediterranean Sea. We assessed the effects derived from the storm comparing changes in benthic community composition at sites exposed to and sheltered from this extreme event. The sites analyzed showed different damage from severe to negligible. The most exposed and impacted site experienced a major shift immediately after the storm, represented by changes in the species richness and beta diversity of benthic species. This site also showed higher compositional variability immediately after the storm and over the following year. The loss of cover of benthic species resulted between 22% and 58%. The damage across these species (e.g. calcareous algae, sponges, anthozoans, bryozoans, tunicates) was uneven, and those with fragile forms were the most impacted, showing cover losses up to 50 to 100%. Interestingly, small patches survived after the storm and began to grow slightly during the following year. In contrast, sheltered sites showed no significant changes in all the studied parameters, indicating no variations due to the storm. This study provides new insights into the responses to large and rare extreme events of Mediterranean communities with low dynamics and long-lived species, which are among the most threatened by the effects of global change.

CASE STUDY: BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN JIU VALLEY NATIONAL PARK	Environmental Engineering and Management Journal	01/06/2014	NA	1	During the last decades, the biodiversity conservation became a constant concern for the specialists in environmental resource management by increasing the awareness of the complexity, fragility and inestimable value of our planet. Nowadays, this issue should be an ethical duty for all the 7.2 billion inhabitants of the planet. The biodiversity conservation should be approached as a multidisciplinary research field, developed in response to the actual world crisis. In this multidisciplinary field the IT has currently a crucial role, since the accountable management of environmental resources is difficult to be conceived without the help of this tool. The paper is part of this multidisciplinary approach, since it discusses the use of an integrated IT project for generating practical measures towards the biodiversity conservation of the Jiu Valley National Park (JVNP).

The method works along two lines, that of habitat diversity and that of species diversity. On the habitat level we measure the diversity in so called 'habitat units'. These units are divided in planar, linear and punctual elements. For each category we calculate a Shannon-Wiener diversity index and a saturation index. The latter is the ratio of the diversity index compared to the maximum diversity possible. On the species level we use the species number and diversity index of vascular plants, as measured in random sampling plots of 100 m(2) (for trees and shrubs) and 4 m(2) (for herbaceous vegetation). In addition, we also use the species number of butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. These numbers are compared with the total species number in Flanders, resulting in a saturation index per park for butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. In this way 20 biodiversity indicators are obtained. The proposed method was applied to the municipal park of Loppem (West-Flanders, Belgium), from which the necessary time budget has been calculated. Since it is the first application of a new method and no reference to other parks is available, the proposed bioindicators have been compared with criteria given in the literature on the selection of biodiversity indicators.

In arid parts of western North America, packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens preserve plant and animal remains for tens of thousands of years. Midden contents are so well preserved that fragments of endogenous ancient DNA (aDNA) can be extracted and analyzed across millennia. Here, we explore the use of shotgun metagenomics to study the aDNA obtained from packrat middens up to 32,000 C-14 years old. Eleven Illumina HiSeq 2500 libraries were successfully sequenced, and between 0.11% and 6.7% of reads were classified using Centrifuge against the NCBI ""nt"" database. Eukaryotic taxa identified belonged primarily to vascular plants with smaller proportions mapping to ascomycete fungi, arthropods, chordates, and nematodes. Plant taxonomic diversity in the middens is shown to change through time and tracks changes in assemblages determined by morphological examination of the plant remains. Amplicon sequencing of ITS2 and rbcL provided minimal data for some middens, but failed at amplifying the highly fragmented DNA present in others. With repeated sampling and deep sequencing, analysis of packrat midden aDNA from well-preserved midden material can provide highly detailed characterizations of past communities of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi present as trace DNA fossils. The prospects for gaining more paleoecological insights from aDNA for rodent middens will continue to improve with optimization of laboratory methods, decreasing sequencing costs, and increasing computational power."

In parts of the world where taxonomic expertise is lacking, species identification has hindered progress in biodiversity conservation, and the only practical, relatively-accurate option, is the use of taxonomic minimalism. We carried out a rapid biodiversity assessment based on three surrogates-land-use (driver-surrogate), terrestrial arthropods (species-surrogate) and morphospecies (taxonomic-surrogate)-to determine the impacts of land-use on biodiversity of the Western Region (Ghana), an area covering similar to 4 % of the West African biodiversity hotspot. We used diversity profiles to visualize the distribution of a total of 8848 arthropod individuals over seven land-use types which define the complete heterogeneity of the landscape. Here, we present both sample and asymptotic diversity profiles of arthropod morphospecies for each land-use type and the potential of each land-use type for conserving arthropods. We conclude that (1) the morphospecies approach is useful for detecting differences in species diversity of land-use types; (2) the concept of asymptotic diversity may not be necessary for land-use based biodiversity comparison; and (3) maximum diversity profiles are useful for determining the land-use conservation values in cases where pristine areas are not available.

An application of the theory of planned behavior in fars province, Iran	Global Ecology and Conservation	01/10/2019	10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00698	10	Earth's well-being depends mainly on the conservation of ecosystem goods and services. However, biodiversity is extensively threatened in agricultural landscapes. Since farmers' decisions and practices are the main determinant factors of on-farm biodiversity conservation, this study was conducted to clarify the underlying constructs of farmers' intention to preserve biodiversity. The Theory of Planned Behavior was applied to investigate the intention of a sample of 274 Iranian farmers towards on-farm biodiversity conservation. In order to increase the predictive power of this theory, the new constructs of knowledge, moral norm and perceived threats of intensified agriculture were added to the model. The results indicated that farmers have a moderate level of knowledge about the value and strategies of biodiversity conservation. Also, they have a favorable attitude toward preserving biodiversity. However, they do not perceive enough control to engage in biodiversity conservation practices. Furthermore, the findings revealed that attitude, perceived threats of intensified agriculture, knowledge, social norms and moral norms are the most relevant factors explaining the farmers' intentions toward biodiversity conservation. In general, the results presented evidence about effectiveness of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the extended model of planned behavior on assessing the farmers' intention to preserve biodiversity. Also, the findings reinforced the available evidence regarding the significance of moral norm and knowledge in development of environmental intention. Accordingly, a number of considerations about improving farmers' intention to preserve on-farm biodiversity are recommended. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our paper represents the conditions under which the contemporary statist conservationist efforts to preserve the urban protected areas (PAs) in India induces a marginal existence and livelihood vulnerability upon the survival of the population residing within these PAs. A recent survey to Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai reflects the ways in which a politics of conservation operates not only in the rural regions but also in cities, in highly inequitable and fabricated ways. This has consequently affected the impoverished, disempowered and impecunious inhabitants who comprise a considerable segment of population in cosmopolitan Mumbai, residing within the PAs. The present article assesses the ways in which in metropolises, PAs by definition determine jurisdictions and exercise rights to exclude the social groups who are marginal and less powerful. This is to preserve a pristine people free aesthetic environment in cities, for which there is an increasing demand from the local elite. The results of the study indicate the socio ecological aspects of the conservation politics in the city of Mumbai. The emergent consequences are in terms of the questions of universal rights to the PAs or reflecting an elitist provision of environmental integrity to the privileged visitors in the city.

We clarify the link between components of the economic value of soil biodiversity and their associated services of particular relevance to soils. We contend that soil biodiversity and associated ecosystem services give rise to two main additive value components in the context of risk and uncertainty: an output value and an insurance value. These are illustrated with examples from soil ecology and a simple heuristic model. The paper also points towards the challenges of capturing such values highlighting the differences between private (individual) and public (global) sources of value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Groundwater microorganisms contain a proportion of unidentified and uncharacterized ultramicrobacteria (UMB) that might play a major role in the bioclogging of geological materials. This study aimed to assess the changes in genetic and metabolic biodiversity when a community of UMB, isolated from groundwater, is stimulated to form biofilms on a ceramic surface. UMB were stimulated with aerobic conditions and injection of molasses, in reactors reproducing groundwater composition and temperature. Concentration of planktonic viable UMB, secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and biofilm thickness were monitored. The assessment of changes in biodiversity was achieved by comparing the initial UMB community to the biofilm community, using the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) method, the cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) sequences, and the Biolog microplate system. The hypothesis stating that indigenous UMB would play a significant role of in the biofilm development was corroborated. Within 13 days of stimulation, the UMB produced 700 mg L-1 of planktonic EPS and formed a biofilm up to a thickness of 1100 mum. This stimulation led to a decrease in genetic diversity and an increase in metabolic diversity. The decrease in genetic diversity was shown by a reduced number of single strand DNA fragments in the SSCP profiles. As such, 16S rDNA sequences from the biofilm revealed the predominance of four bacterial groups: Zoogloea, Bacillus/Paenibacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonads. A significant increase in metabolic diversity was shown by a highest substrate richness profile and a lower substrate evenness profile of the biofilm bacterial population (p = 0.0 and p = 0.09, respectively). This higher metabolic diversity might be a consequence of the stimulation that seemed to favor the growth of bacteria having a high nutritional versatility. Stimulation of UMB, isolated from groundwater, was effective to form a biofilm having a high metabolic biodiversity.

Farm dams as biodiversity reserves in Australia	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/10/2009	10.1007/s10531-009-9623-5	27	In many countries the ubiquitous farm dam or pond is an integral component of agricultural landscapes. In Australia there are in excess of half a million farm ponds, used largely for irrigation or for watering stock. In contrast to Europe, these wetlands are being decommissioned in response to the introduction of government policy that regulates water usage from these dams. They are also being in-filled with expanding urbanisation without consideration of their benefits as reservoirs of biodiversity. We compared the diversity of macroinvertebrates in farm dams with nearby stream habitats on a cool temperate tableland in central New South Wales. There was greater diversity in-stream than in the dams; however, dam sites showed a larger mean diversity and total diversity per site than in-stream. Species recorded in-stream were more frequently represented by single individuals while species were recorded more consistently in dams. We also observed that macroinvertebrate assemblages were more similar to those in the same dam in different seasons than to adjacent dams in the same season. Some species recorded had not previously been recorded from farm dams. In contrast to the general consensus that Australian farm dams are homogeneous environments with a range of common widespread species, we showed that they provide a variety of sustainable reservoirs of biodiversity within the landscape. They also have the potential to provide 'stepping stones' between undisturbed and modified habitats, in part countering the fragmentation that occurs as a result of agricultural practices.

Here, we evaluate a global biodiversity education campaign's impact through a repeated-measures survey of nearly 5000 visitors to 20 zoos and aquariums located in 14 countries. By comparing visitors' pre- and post-visit responses combined across respondents, we found significant aggregate improvements in their biodiversity understanding and their knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity. Respondents who reported seeing the education campaign's interpretive graphic panels and informative films showed a significantly higher aggregate increase in their understanding of biodiversity and actions to protect it as compared to respondents who did not see the campaign materials. These findings reaffirm the value of education at zoos and aquariums to engage members of the public with biodiversity-related issues. The results also demonstrate that the aggregate impact from such experiences can be enhanced through coordinated public engagement initiatives.

As the mechanism is outlined as a new opportunity, the expectations need to be analyzed relative to the ensuing changes in rights and responsibilities over biodiversity degradation, conservation and restoration. In this paper we conduct an analysis of rights and responsibilities using literature and empirical material. Our empirical case is in Finland, where ecological compensation and biodiversity offsets represent an emerging avenue for conservation. We find that rights to conservation, property and economic activity have generally not been explicitly addressed in parallel, and that the focus has been on evaluating biodiversity loss through ecological assessment or as an ethical notion. Offsetting literature focuses on developer rights to a predictable operational environment rather than on human rights to biodiversity or the property rights of offset suppliers. At the same time, the literature on offsets analyzing the responsibilities over management, avoiding degradation and meeting societal expectations, has placed much emphasis on governance and control by authorities. These analyses result in doubts and criticism of the capacity of governance arrangements to reach the set targets. Echoing the literature, the Finnish case shows that even though the mechanism is framed as a way to place the responsibility onto developers, numerous responsibilities are expected to be taken by authorities or a yet non-existing mediating actor, while developer rights are expected to be secured and landowner rights are either mostly assumed not to change, or not addressed at all. Our study shows that the assumptions on rights and responsibilities need to be exposed to empirical analysis, to support the design of meaningful new institutional arrangements.

Here, we propose a biodiversity intactness index (BII) for assessing progress towards this target that is simple and practical - but sensitive to important factors that influence biodiversity status - and which satisfies the criteria for policy relevance set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Application of the BII is demonstrated on a large region ( 4 3 10 6 km 2) of southern Africa. The BII score in the year 2000 is about 84%: in other words, averaged across all plant and vertebrate species in the region, populations have declined to 84% of their presumed pre-modern levels. The taxonomic group with the greatest loss is mammals, at 71% of pre-modern levels, and the ecosystem type with the greatest loss is grassland, with 74% of its former populations remaining. During the 1990s, a population decline of 0.8% is estimated to have occurred.

The international MAB/UNESCO programme which was running between 1988 and 1998 was related to the land/water ecotones, mainly riparian zones. This article, inspired by this programme seeks to highlight the role of riparian processes on biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity under different climatic conditions. Their role is investigated by focusing on: i) the lateral ecotone between land and water systems, ii) their longitudinal corridor structure and, iii) the dry-wet cycles. This information is then used to suggest the value of riparian zones in landscape management. We emphasize the key roles of the ecotonal structure, longitudinal connectivity and timing of the occurrence of wet-dry cycles for riparian zones to process nitrate fluxes and to maintain high levels of biodiversity at the landscape scale. In the context of the worldwide transformations of flow regimes, the deterioration of water quality and loss of biodiversity, restoring riparian zones is both a key objective and a formidable challenge that implies envisioning the consequences of management actions on the long term, considering entire river basins, and paying attention to other environmental, regional and global changes.

4312	WOS:000426093400010	Assessing the effect of emergent vegetation in a surface-flow constructed wetland on eutrophication reversion and biodiversity enhancement	Ecological Engineering	01/04/2018	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.021	12	A free water-surface constructed wetland (F4-unit) was created in a Mediterranean protected site to treat eutrophic inflows to the Albufera de Valencia lagoon, and enhance biodiversity. In 2013, the F4-unit was divided into three subunits and planted with different compositions of emergent macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Iris pseudacorus, and a mixture of several macrophytes: F4-Reed, F4-Iris and F4-Mixed subunits). Two nine-month periods were monitored after planting, and water quality variables were measured in the inflows and outflows. Waterfowl occupation and plankton biomass were analyzed to evaluate their role in eutrophication reversion. The low removal efficiencies related to scarce vegetation development and wind disturbance in the first period, significantly improved in the second, particularly in the F4-Reed subunit (total cumulative mass removals of 438, 363 and 372 kg of nitrogen, 57, 30 and 48 kg of phosphorus and 7109, 573 and 2315 kg of suspended solids in the Reed, Iris and Mixed F4 subunits). This was due to the high continuous coverage (around 70%) achieved by reeds, but also by other species that spontaneously germinated from the seed bank (cattails, Paspalum sp). The constructed wetland significantly reduced the exported microalgal biomass, stimulated the potential mixotrophic phytoplankton groups, such as Euglenophyceae, and produced large quantities of zooplankton, particularly ostracods and cladocerans, which efficiently grazed on microalgae. The total cumulative mass removal of chlorophyll for the second period of operation represented 2.6 times more removal than in the first period. Almost 50% of the waterfowl species visiting the zone were of special conservation concern. Differences in vegetation structure between subunits drove a concrete selection of stopover sites for migratory, endangered shorebirds that had low impact on solid resuspension. Endangered, large and medium-sized waterfowl (higher impact on resuspension while foraging), more abundant in the post-breeding period, showed no preferences between subunits. This study supports the idea of recommending the configuration of these kinds of systems for managing eutrophicated waters in protected sites and enhancing waterfowl species of conservation concern.

Two recent New Zealand examples of biodiversity offsets are reviewed-while both are positive for biodiversity conservation, the process by which they were developed and approved was based more on the precautionary principal than on any formal framework. Based on this review and the broader offset literature, an environmental framework for developing and approving biodiversity offsets, comprising six principles, is outlined: (1) biodiversity offsets should only be used as part of an hierarchy of actions that first seeks to avoid impacts and then minimizes the impacts that do occur; (2) a guarantee is provided that the offset proposed will occur; (3) biodiversity offsets are inappropriate for certain ecosystem (or habitat) types because of their rarity or the presence of threatened species within them; (4) offsets most often involve the creation of new habitat, but can include protection of existing habitat where there is currently no protection; (5) a clear currency is required that allows transparent quantification of values to be lost and gained in order to ensure ecological equivalency between cleared and offset areas; (6) offsets must take into account both the uncertainty involved in obtaining the desired outcome for the offset area and the time-lag that is involved in reaching that point.

Policies that influence agronomic decisions are rarely made with an appreciation of the trade-offs that exist between food production, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. We present an approach that can reveal such trade-offs when used to assess current and future policy options that affect agricultural inputs (e.g. pesticides, nutrients) and practices. In addition, by demonstrating it in a pesticide policy context, we show how safeguarding a range of ecosystem services may have serious implications for UK food security. We suggest that policy change is most usefully implemented at a landscape scale to promote multifunctionality, tailoring pesticide risk assessment and incentives for management that support bundles of ecosystem services to specific landscape contexts. In some instances tough trade-offs may need to be accepted. However, our approach can ensure that current knowledge is used to inform policy decisions for progress towards a more balanced food production system. (C) 2016 The Authors.

With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate engineering (or geoengineering') is receiving increasing attention for its potential to limit anthropogenic climate change and its damaging effects. Proposed techniques, such as ocean fertilization for carbon dioxide removal or stratospheric sulfate injections to reduce incoming solar radiation, would significantly alter atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environments, yet potential side-effects of their implementation for ecosystems and biodiversity have received little attention. A literature review was carried out to identify details of the potential ecological effects of climate engineering techniques. A group of biodiversity and environmental change researchers then employed a modified Delphi expert consultation technique to evaluate this evidence and prioritize the effects based on the relative importance of, and scientific understanding about, their biodiversity and ecosystem consequences. The key issues and knowledge gaps are used to shape a discussion of the biodiversity and ecosystem implications of climate engineering, including novel climatic conditions, alterations to marine systems and substantial terrestrial habitat change. This review highlights several current research priorities in which the climate engineering context is crucial to consider, as well as identifying some novel topics for ecological investigation.

The extent to which the locations that are most valuable for ecosystem services coincide with those that support the most biodiversity is of critical importance when designing conservation and land management strategies. There are, however, few studies on which to base any kind of conclusion about possible spatial patterns of association between ecosystem services and biodiversity. Moreover, little is known about the sensitivity of the conclusions to the quality of the data available, or to the choice and size of the region used for analysis. Here, we first present national-scale estimates of the spatial covariance in areas important for ecosystem services and biodiversity (richness of species of conservation concern), using Britain as a case study. We then explore how these associations are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the available data, the spatial extent of our study region and to regional variation across the study area. Our analyses reveal a mixture of negative and positive associations. In particular, the regionalization analysis shows that one can arrive at diametrically opposing conclusions about relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity by studying the same question within different areas, even within a moderately small island. Synthesis and applications. In a policy context, the location-specific nature of relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity underscores the importance of multi-scale environmental decision-making, so as to reflect both local conditions and broader-scale priorities. The results also suggest that efforts to establish general patterns of congruence in ecosystem services and biodiversity may offer a less constructive way forward than do more regional approaches.

Encouragingly, complementarity-derived priority sets of focal taxa were found highly effective in representing non-target taxa in a study from Ugandan forests. It has been proposed cross-taxon congruence in complementarity is less distinct in temperate regions than in the tropics, because temperate regions have fewer species, and hence focal taxa may be less effective as they are less diverse. To test this, we used all available atlas data (10 x 10 km scale) in Denmark (butterflies, birds, amphibians, reptiles, large moths, bats and click beetles, n = 434 species), and looked at whether conservation priority areas based on one taxonomic group represent species richness of other groups in a highly fragmented landscape. We apply a new approach (based on G-statistics) that enables statistical evaluation of cross-taxon congruence in complementarity-derived priority sets. We found indications that the same taxa represented other groups effectively and exhibited cross-taxon congruence in complementarity-derived priority sets. Birds performed significantly, but relatively poorly, butterflies somewhat better and bats relatively well in representing species richness of other groups. Large moths performed best and may be an overlooked predictor of diversity in other animal taxa.

The goal of this study is to provide a refined biostratigraphic scheme for the Lower Ktaoua, the Upper Tiouririne, the Upper Ktaoua and the Lower Second Bani formations in order to locate the initial effects of the Late Ordovician glaciation on the composition of assemblages of organic-walled microfossils. Five Late Ordovician chitinozoan biozones belonging to the North Gondwana zonation are identified. During the late Caradoc and early Ashgill, no significant changes in chitinozoan assemblages are recorded that could be attributed to any dramatic climatic and/or environmental events. The almost absence of phytoplanktonic elements (acritarchs and leiospheres) and of cryptospores in the fistulosa/barbata and in the nigerica biozones are interpreted as resulting of lower offshore environmental conditions. The reappearance of a variety of palynomorphs in the lower part of the elongata biozone does not indicate drastic climatic changes but more likely a shallowing trend of the marine environment and an increased primary production, possibly related to a cooling of the surface water masses subsequently to early effects of a general climatic cooling. The first obvious evidence of the Late Ordovician glaciation occurs in the lower part of the elongata biozone, at the base of the sandy member topping the Lower Second Bani Formation. This sandy deposit is interpreted as the result of a dramatic fall of the sea level due to the development of the Himantian ice cap on Gondwana. This short-lived glaciation ended when the northern Gondwanan ice cap melted during the upper part of the elongata and the oulebsiri biozones. A biological crisis affected both the chitinozoans and the acritarchs just after this glaciation, i.e., in the latest Himantian. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such species may be especially common on islands given that some islands have had a relatively recent history of human settlement. It is likely that select island species considered native might have achieved their current distributions via direct or indirect human actions. As an example, we explore the origins of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis bermudensis) on the island of Bermuda. Considered native to the island and a distinct subspecies, this population has diverged in morphology relative to mainland North America. Using microsatellite markers and simulation of island colonization, we show that the Bermuda population of bluebirds is the likely result of a single colonization event that occurred during the 1600s, making this a cryptic invader. To our knowledge, this is one of the youngest examples of a terrestrial vertebrate cryptic invader. We suggest that the eastern bluebird is not an isolated case of cryptic invader on either Bermuda or elsewhere and that caution be exercised when studying present-day distributions of organisms.

We test and quantify the contention that different trapping methods routinely target different families. We identify the south-north (and upland/lowland) patterns and generate a set of hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location Australia and Papua New Guinea. Methods A total of 28,647 Diptera collected using canopy knockdown, yellow pan (water) traps and Malaise traps have been sorted to 56 families following these surveys. Comparative analyses across sites from Lamington National Park in south-east Queensland, Australia to the Kau Wildlife area in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea, of the dipteran assemblages, and separately, of the 14 families which collectively made up 95.8% of the sample, are presented. Results Ordination by multi-dimensional scaling and analyses of variances showed that the three methods complemented each other in terms of target families and, together, sampled a large proportion of the expected fauna of these sites. Ordinations on a method-by-method basis permitted the identification of groups of sites and analyses of variance indicated which taxa differed significantly across these groups. Main conclusions Recurrent patterns and associated hypotheses about their generation emerge from the data. These mirror floristic differences and reflect the biogeographic history of the sites since the Miocene. Clear linkages between the lowland faunas of Papua New Guinea and northern Australia are evident and are reflected in the abundances of the Dolichopodidae, Empididae, Muscidae and Tipulidae (other groupings underlined the essential difference of the New Guinean fauna which had characteristic proportions of Cecidomyiidae, Chironomidae, Dolichopodidae, Phoridae and Psychodidae). A subtropical grouping of families was evident comprising, inter alia, Chloropidae, Mycetophilidae, Drosophilidae and Phoridae which was frequently linked with the higher elevation tropical fauna at Robson's Creek, Atherton Tablelands. The long isolated, high elevation, rain-forested massif at Eungella, central Queensland often emerged as a unique entity in the analyses, characterized by the high numbers of and proportions of Chironomidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae and Empididae. This study supports the case for the wider use of Diptera in biodiversity analyses, complementing extensive earlier analyses which have used, predominantly, large coleopteran assemblages. The results indicate the potential power of family-level analyses at large geographical scales and contribute to the ongoing debate on 'taxonomic sufficiency'.

Their effects are particularly evident in aquatic ecosystems, as chemical concentrations in water, and as a disease in biodiversity and species richness. East Fork Poplar Creek and its tributary, Bear Creek flow inside the Reservation and have highly degraded natural habitats, unsatisfactory water quality and impoverished biota. PCB concentrations exceed recommended criteria for aquatic life safety and appear as a primary cause of environment degradation and reduced species richness. An uptake model, FGETS (Food and Gill Exchange of Toxic Substances) was used to analyse fish biodiversity and distribution in the two streams in relation to bioaccumulation of PCB congeners 1254 and 1260. Bioaccumulation of the two polychlorinated biphenyls was estimated in four different species of fish common in Tennessee rivers and streams: Catostomus commersoni, Lepomis macrochirus, Cyprinus carpio and Micropterus salmoides to integrate the available set of data and to evaluate the entity of human impact on these escosystems.

Twenty appropriate indicators from four thematic groups, i.e., land use management, nature conservation, landscape diversity and inherent natural quality, were selected on the basis of use in the literature, the requirement of consistent national datasets and statistical analysis. Each variable was divided into four appropriate classes to produce indicator values according to expert judgement. These classes were added together for each 1 km square to provide a single score to develop an expert system to define HNV. A statistical analysis showed there are few moderate correlations between the individual indicators, suggesting that their selection was sound. The HNV scores for all 1 km squares with agricultural land in Estonia exhibit a normal distribution. The top and bottom 10% of the 1 km squares (3707 and 3501 squares, respectively) were identified in order to investigate the structure of the data further. The former is termed Exceptionally High HNV (EHNV) and the latter Relatively Low HNV (RLNV), while the intermediate class is termed Median HNV (MHNV). The distribution of these groups in Estonia shows readily identifiable patterns linked to known biodiversity ""hot spots"". A cluster analysis within the EHNV squares produced three classes whose distribution and composition are described to demonstrate the detailed character of Estonian agricultural land with high biodiversity. The methodology is adaptable to other countries that have extensive relevant data bases. The map will be valuable for agricultural policy makers to identify zones with high biodiversity where agri-environment schemes can be targeted. Other stakeholders could also direct development away from EHNV 1 km squares. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	Kikas, Tambet ; Bunce, Robert G.

Governments split up all land in unprotected and protected land, and there are internationally traded consumption goods that use either protected or unprotected land as an input in production. Global biodiversity is increasing in aggregate protected land. The willingness-to-pay for biodiversity (conservation) is larger in the 'rich' North than in the 'poor' South. There is an international market on which governments and possibly a coalition of northern countries may demand and/or offer unprotected land for conversion into protected land. If a coalition exists, it turns out to be the only demander on that market, and its demand is increasing in coalition size. We investigate the formation of self-enforcing coalitions when governments and the coalition either take prices as given or exert market power. We find that there are no such coalitions, when external biodiversity benefits are large, but there may be self-enforcing coalitions, even large ones, if these benefits are sufficiently small. Furthermore, it is possible that the South suffers a welfare loss when a self-enforcing coalition of northern countries pays for biodiversity conservation in the South.

This gives rise to spatial externalities that - if not adequately compensated - may lead to an underprovision of public goods and services. This article proposes two models that would expand the existing intergovernmental fiscal transfer system from the state to the local level in Saxony, Germany, to include designated protected areas; the models are based on actual administrative, social, and economic data from 2002. Conservation units (CUs) are identified in each municipality by overlaying Geographical information System (GIS) layers of the various categories of protected areas over a total of 537 municipal borders in Saxony. The first model considers CUs within the calculation of general lump-sum transfers by ""translating"" CUs into the generic indicator of inhabitants. In the second model, a specified amount of the overall transfer sum is devoted to conservation according to the share of CUs a municipality holds in relation to its total area. Both approaches lead to higher transfers, especially to rural communities (though to varying degrees), thereby acknowledging the latter's ecological services to society."

Retention of minimum wetland local populations sustained through occasional migration. Retention of minimum wetland densities in human-dominated landscapes iis fundamental to conserving these organisms. An analysis of wetland mosaics was performed for two regions of the northeastern United States to asses the degree to which historical wetland loss alters the metrics of wetland mosaics and to asses potential future effects mediated by differently structured wetland regulations. These analyses indicated that profound reductions in wetland proximity are associated with increased human populations and that protections for all wetlands > 1 acre (0.4ha) are likely required to retain wetland densities minimally sufficient to sustain wetland biota.

1949	WOS:000229448100008	Conservation of marine and coastal biodiversity in Brazil	Conservation Biology	01/06/2005	NA	53	The invertebrate benthos, especially the micro- and mesofaunal components, of the Brazilian seas is still poorly known. Relatively few species have been recorded, reflecting the lack of research in this field. The intertidal zone, to depths of about 20 in, has been studied the most, and there the numbers of endemic species are relatively high. The diversity of demersal and pelagic fishes is similar among the major marine regions, and endemism is typically low (<5%) and restricted to reef species. Surveys in southeastern Brazil (depths of up to 2000 in) have recorded more than 1300 species of benthic animals, of which the Porifera, Cnidaria, Sipuncula, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Scaphopoda, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Ophiuroidea, Bryozoa, and Brachiopoda were the most abundant or frequent Excepting the molluscs, decapods (brachiurans), cirripeds, and echinoderms, the faunas of salt marshes, coral reefs, and islands remain poorly known. Marine and estuarine demersal teleosts include 617 species in 26 orders and 118 families. Just over half the species (337) are Perciformes. Overexploitation, for food and by the aquarium fish trade, habitat degradation and destruction, alien species introductions, pernicious tourism, and pollution are the principal threats to Brazil's marine biodiversity. The Minister of the Environment lists 34 threatened and 10 overexploited or at risk of being overexploited benthic species. Fishes officially listed as threatened include 15 species of sharks and rays and 7 teleosts. Another six elasmobranchs and 27 teleosts are currently or potentially being overexploited. Conservation of marine biodiversity in Brazil is still broadly inadequate despite existing legislation and several protected areas. The number and size of marine protected areas are insufficient, and some still lack management plans or have yet to receive the appropriate measures and infrastructure to make them effective. Fisheries administration and management is still precarious and in many areas lacks effective participation of local communities. Major conservation initiatives include the identification of keys areas for biodiversity conservation, surveys, intensified monitoring of fisheries, environmental education, and the creation and improved management of protected areas.

These soils are old, cold and dry with low contents of organic carbon and nitrogen. Habitats adjacent to water (lakes and ice melts) have significant biological activity as demonstrated by the presence of algal mats, lichens and small invertebrates, particularly nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers. In contrast, there are extensive areas in the Dry Valleys that are extremely dry with less than 5% moisture content. These soils are often salty and appear to be barren of life as they have a coarse texture due to their lack of plant organic material. In contrast, molecular techniques (DNA extraction from soils, cloning and rDNA sequence analysis) demonstrated the presence of a complex micro-eukaryotic food web whose structure and composition varied with moisture content and location. Micro-eukaryotic communities in soils with 0.2-1.3% moisture were represented by species of the yeast genus Trichosporon and an unidentified clade of micro-eukaryotes, whereas levels from 3.1% to 4.9% contained complex food webs including primary producers (chlorophytes and stramenopiles), symbionts (lichen associated fungi), saprophytes (fungi), predators (alveolates and cercozoans) and fungal nematode parasite/pathogens. The soils had a diversity of species (80 species from 15 sites) with a restricted number (3-21 species) at each site. The sensitive and measurable community structure of the low moisture Dry Valley soils provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine local and global environmental effects on micro-eukaryotic community dynamics with multiple trophic levels.

Analyses included expected and observed species curves, rare species analysis, additive partitioning of alpha-and beta-diversity, and canonical redundancy analysis. A total of 10,517 individuals were recorded from 75 species and 33 reef fish families, representing 85% of expected richness. Species richness beta-diversity was dependent on the site scale, while the alpha-diversity of the Shannon diversity was most significant at the transect scale. Canonical partitioning showed species richness and Shannon diversity was explained by spatially-structured environmental components. Variation in species composition and abundance was explained by a purely environmental component. Therefore, elements of habitat structure ( especially corals), topographic complexity, and refuge availability determine fish species diversity. Our results suggest that greater emphasis is required to conserve sites that promote beta-diversity, increasing fish spatial diversity. In Isla Isabel, these sites would be mostly those located at eastern and southern of protected sides, where coral reef patches are well represented. The results of this multi-scale analysis are valuable and useful as an addition and complement to the holistic management strategies implemented at Isla Isabel.

We present national population trends for a species-rich and ecologically diverse insect group: widespread and common macro-moths in Britain. Two-thirds of the 337 species studied have declined over the 35 yr study and 21% (71) of the species declined > 10% 10 yr(-1). If IUCN (World Conservation Union) criteria are applied at the national scale, these 71 species would be regarded as threatened. The declines are at least as great as those recently reported for British butterflies and exceed those of British birds and vascular plants. These results have important and worrying implications for species such as insectivorous birds and bats, and suggests as-yet undetected declines may be widespread among temperate-zone insects.

The effects of different land uses vary across ecosystem types, yet most broad-scale models have failed to account for this variation. The effects of land use may be different in systems characterized by low water availability because of the unusual conditions within these systems. Drylands are expanding, currently occupying over 40% of the terrestrial land, while Mediterranean systems are highly endangered biodiversity hotspots. However, the impact of land use on biodiversity in these biomes is yet to be assessed. Using a database of local biodiversity surveys, we assess the effects of land use on biodiversity in the world's drylands and Mediterranean ecosystems. We compare the average species richness, total abundance, species diversity, ecological dominance, endemism rates, and compositional turnover across different land uses. In drylands, there was a strong turnover in species composition in disturbed land uses compared with undisturbed natural habitat (primary vegetation), but other measures of biodiversity did not respond significantly. However, it is important to note that the sample size for drylands was very low, a gap which should be filled promptly. Mediterranean environments showed a very high sensitivity of biodiversity to land uses. In this biome, even habitat recovering after past disturbance (secondary vegetation) had substantially reduced biodiversity and altered community composition compared with primary vegetation. In an effort to maintain original biodiversity and the ecosystem functions it supports within Mediterranean biomes, conservation measures should therefore prioritize the preservation of remaining primary vegetation.

4178	WOS:000495581200002	Improving access to biodiversity data for, and from, EIAs - a data publishing framework built to global standards	Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal	01/01/2012	10.1080/14615517.2012.705068	5	Biodiversity information obtained during environmental impact assessments (EIAs) is rarely accessible for other uses following the completion of the EIA. Such data need to be made readily accessible; adding them to publicly accessible national datasets is important if biodiversity science, conservation and future decisions based on environmental assessment are to benefit from new biodiversity data and improved biodiversity data coverage. An 'EIA Biodiversity Data Publishing Framework', based on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) global standards, is thus proposed to meet this need. This paper outlines the GBIF-catalysed initiative to establish such an operational framework for uptake by the EIA community, as well as options that are available for data publishing in the absence of such a framework. It reviews the current state of accessibility and management of the primary biodiversity data associated with EIA studies, and highlights the urgent need for uptake of a range of data-publishing tools and best practices for making EIA biodiversity data exchangeable using globally accepted standards. Lessons learnt from pilot projects in India and South Africa underline the call for the rapid uptake of a national-to-global scale EIA Biodiversity Data Publishing Framework.

These benefits need to be balanced with the risk of lost crop production from weed competition. A simulation model of weed growth and competition was developed and parameterised for 15 autumn germinating weed species common in UK winter wheat fields. The model was validated over 2 years and used to explore possible management options for reconciling the conservation of in-field biodiversity with winter wheat production. The model successfully predicted biomass production and crop yield loss from weed populations sown in two growing seasons. The predicted outcome of weed competition was highly dependent on weather, particularly the period of over winter growth. The model allows the risk associated with the economic weed threshold approach to be effectively managed-providing the control of less competitive broad leaf weeds is delayed until the spring. There were large differences in the model parameters between the species and the hypothesis that weed growth and competition could be modelled on the level of weed functional group was rejected.

We propose an index, 'essentiality', to assess the consequence of extinction of particular species for community biomass production. The essentiality of a species in a given community is the extent to which the functional role of that species is irreplaceable by the remaining species, calculated as the relative difference in yields between communities with and without the focal species. Species with zero essentiality play a completely replaceable functional role in their communities. Positive essentialities suggest irreplaceable contributions by species to their communities; species with essentiality values even higher than their dominance in the community may exhibit facilitative effects on the other species. Negative essentialities indicate interference of the focal species with other members of the same community. We applied this index to data from a microcosm experiment, in which five algal species were grown in monocultures and in all possible species combinations. Essentiality varied greatly across species. Two species had overall zero essentiality values throughout the experiment, two species had positive essentiality values which were lower than the species' dominance, and the remaining species had negative essentiality. Furthermore, two out of the five species had essentiality values dependent on species richness of communities from which they were lost; essentiality decreased with an increase in species richness. The essentiality index provides a straightforward measurement of functional consequences of individual species loss, which complements the existing analytical methods by focusing on the detection of facilitation and interference.

The concept of surrogate species, those whose protection affords the protection of other species, is considered a conservation short-cut. Although surrogate species have been used as practical conservation tools, whether they serve as indicators of the reproductive output of other species is still unknown. We hypothesized that the reproductive output of the eastern marsh harrier (Circus spilonotus) can serve as a surrogate for both the adult abundance and reproductive output of sympatric birds. In a fragmented wetland landscape (approximately 211.60 km2), we measured the reproductive output of harriers for 3 years and conducted replicated counts of the adults and juveniles of other wetland bird species in wetland patches that varied in harrier reproductive output. We used playbacks of mobbing calls in replicated counts and accounted for imperfect detection using an N-mixture niodel. We modeled adult and juvenile abundances for 10 and 7 species, respectively, and showed that the reproduction-based habitat quality of the marsh harrier (cumulative numbers of both years occupying the habitat and chicks produced) was positively associated with adult abundances in four species and with juvenile abundances in five species. We suggest that areas with high reproductive output of several sympatric bird species could be selected based on the reproduction-based habitat quality of the marsh harrier. Furthermore, the approach combining the playback of mobbing calls and N-mixture models enabled us to estimate juvenile abundances for many bird species on a landscape scale over a short period of time.

The naturally originated and anthropogenic progress of the mosaic-like evolution, as well as the man-induced factors and natural constraints are described. The past and present close linkages between management and biodiversity are then analysed by means of a few, outstanding cases typical of the geographical region. The management shift on increasing economically marginal forest area (abandonment) appears to be the major force currently driving connections with inherent and associated biodiversity. The goals following the new-established environmental roles of forests have shifted towards adaptive management, namely the implementation of locally tailored rules in accordance with prominent forest functions. Key priorities to face up to the new scenarios are then discussed. Economic and policy implications are addressed with reference to multipurpose forestry and the related annual flow of outputs. It is shown the role of water-related services, as well the provision of various non-wood forest products and public goods in addition to wood and other traditional forest outputs. Reference is also made to the dualism between the Northern and the South-Eastern Mediterranean countries due to different level of economic development (and pressure of forest resources) together with very different institutional structures, i.e. public ownership in Southern and South-Eastern Mediterranean countries. Nevertheless, the situation is going to become more harmonious in the medium run by growing economic development, the affirmation of local rights on forest resources, globalisation and, above all, rural out migration and exchanges of peoples confirming the traditional role of the Mediterranean Region at cross road of South-North and Eastern-Western cultures.

6121	WOS:000175634700002	A terrain-based paired-site sampling design to assess biodiversity losses from eastern hemlock decline	Environmental Monitoring and Assessment	01/06/2002	NA	18	Biodiversity surveys are often hampered by the inability to control extraneous sources of variability introduced into comparisons of populations across a heterogenous landscape. If not specifically accounted for a priori, this noise can weaken comparisons between sites, and can make it difficult to draw inferences about specific ecological processes. We developed a terrain-based, paired-site sampling design to analyze differences in aquatic biodiversity between streams draining eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forests, and those draining mixed hardwood forests in Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (USA). The goal of this design was to minimize variance due to terrain influences on stream communities, while representing the range of hemlock dominated stream environments present in the park. We used geographic information systems (GIS) and cluster analysis to define and partition hemlock dominated streams into terrain types based on topographic variables and stream order. We computed similarity of forest stands within terrain types and used this information to pair hemlock-dominated streams with hardwood counterparts prior to sampling. We evaluated the effectiveness of the design through power analysis and found that power to detect differences in aquatic invertebrate taxa richness was highest when sites were paired and terrain type was included as a factor in the analysis. Precision of the estimated difference in mean richness was nearly doubled using the terrain-based, paired site design in comparison to other evaluated designs. Use of this method allowed us to sample stream communities representative of park-wide forest conditions while effectively controlling for landscape variability.

It remains unknown whether such shifts in biodiversity and species composition may, themselves, be major contributors to the total, long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers on ecosystem functioning. Moreover, although numerous experiments have shown that random losses of species impact the functioning of ecosystems, human-caused losses of biodiversity are rarely random. Here we use results from long-term grassland field experiments to test for direct effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on ecosystem productivity, and for indirect effects of enrichment on productivity mediated by resultant species losses. We found that ecosystem productivity decreased through time most in plots that lost the most species. Chronic nitrogen addition also led to the nonrandom loss of initially dominant native perennial C-4 grasses. This loss of dominant plant species was associated with twice as great a loss of productivity per lost species than occurred with random species loss in a nearby biodiversity experiment. Thus, although chronic nitrogen enrichment initially increased productivity, it also led to loss of plant species, including initially dominant species, which then caused substantial diminishing returns from nitrogen fertilization. In contrast, elevated CO2 did not decrease grassland plant diversity, and it consistently promoted productivity over time. Our results support the hypothesis that the long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers of environmental change on ecosystem functioning can strongly depend on how such drivers gradually decrease biodiversity and restructure communities.

However, how the spatial arrangement of crop fields and other habitats in landscapes impacts arthropods and their functions is poorly known. Synthesising data from 49 studies (1515 landscapes) across Europe, we examined effects of landscape composition (% habitats) and configuration (edge density) on arthropods in fields and their margins, pest control, pollination and yields. Configuration effects interacted with the proportions of crop and non-crop habitats, and species' dietary, dispersal and overwintering traits led to contrasting responses to landscape variables. Overall, however, in landscapes with high edge density, 70% of pollinator and 44% of natural enemy species reached highest abundances and pollination and pest control improved 1.7- and 1.4-fold respectively. Arable-dominated landscapes with high edge densities achieved high yields. This suggests that enhancing edge density in European agroecosystems can promote functional biodiversity and yield-enhancing ecosystem services.

Ecological niches were modelled and potential distributions delimited for 285 bird and 114 mammal species using a genetic algorithm based on locality information from museum specimens and 15 selected environmental attributes. Potential distributions were transformed into hypothesized current distributions based on species-habitat associations as reflected in a recent land-use map. Although species richness was lower when distributions were reduced from potential to current, spatial patterns of potential and current richness were similar. Heuristic, complementarity-based prioritization procedures were used to identify combinations of areas and sites with maximal species representation: the biosphere reserves included 79% of birds and 74% of mammal species; eight priority areas provided an additional 11% of birds and 13% of mammals; the remaining 10% of birds and 13% of mammals were concentrated in new sites across the study area.

However, it is unclear how and to what extent the influence of temperature on metabolism scales up to shape large-scale diversity patterns. In order to clarify the roles of temperature and metabolism, new theory is needed. Here, we establish such theory and model eco-evolutionary dynamics of trophic networks along a broad temperature gradient. In the model temperature can influence, via metabolism, resource supply, consumers' vital rates and mutation rate. Mutation causes heritable variation in consumer body size, which diversifies and governs consumer function in the ecological network. The model predicts diversity to increase with temperature if resource supply is temperature-dependent, whereas temperature-dependent consumer vital rates cause diversity to decrease with increasing temperature. When combining both thermal dependencies, a unimodal temperature-diversity pattern evolves, which is reinforced by temperature-dependent mutation rate. Studying coexistence criteria for two consumers showed that these outcomes are owing to temperature effects on mutual invasibility and facilitation. Our theory shows how and why metabolism can influence diversity, generates predictions useful for understanding biodiversity gradients and represents an extendable framework that could include factors such as colonization history and niche conservatism.

In dynamic environments the rate of habitat destruction and recreation (i.e. the landscape turnover rate), the minimum amount of potential habitat, its spatial configuration as well as the environmental conditions determining habitat quality are crucial factors for species occurrence. We analysed species responses to environmental parameters and to the spatio-temporal configuration of urban brownfield habitats in a multi-species approach (37 plant and 43 insect species). Species presence/absence data and soil parameters, site age, vegetation structure and landscape context were recorded by random stratified sampling at 133 study plots in industrial areas in the city of Bremen (Germany). Based on the field data, we predicted species occurrences by species distribution models using a multi-model inference approach. Predicted species communities were driven by successional age both at the scale of a single building lot and at the landscape scale. Minimum average succession time of brownfield habitats required to support all and especially regionally rare species depended on the proportion of available open space; the larger the potential habitat area the faster the acceptable turnover. Most plant, grasshopper, and leafhopper species modelled could be maintained at an intermediate turnover rate (mean age of 10-15 years) and a proportion of open sites of at least 40%. Our modelling approach provides the opportunity of inferring optimal spatio-temporal landscape configurations for urban conservation management from patch scale species-environment relationships. The results indicate that urban planning should incorporate land use dynamics into the management of urban biodiversity.

Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here, we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.

The experiment was conducted at the Solbergstrand mesocosm (Norwegian Institute for Water Research) using subtidal sediment collected from Bjornehodebukta, a small sheltered bay in the Oslofjord. For 3 of the bioturbating species (Brissopsis lyrifera, Aphrodita aculeata and Amphiura chiajei) a positive, linear relationship was demonstrated between bioturbator abundance and measures of species richness (number of species and Margalef species richness). It was suggested that the presence of these bioturbating species increased oxygen penetration into the sediment, leading to an enhancement in the ability of benthic systems to process organic material. This had a beneficial effect on the associated fauna in terms of maintaining levels of diversity. For Nephtys caeca, highest species diversity was seen in the low abundance treatments. Predation by N. caeca on small polychaetes is proposed as a possible explanation of the lower diversity in high-density treatments. It is concluded that B. lyrifera, A. aculeata, A. chiajei and N. caeca are functionally similar with respect to setting the diversity of the associated macrobenthic community and may therefore fulfill the same role within the benthic ecosystem. The presence of Calocaris macandreae, Nuculana minuta and Astarte sulcata had no detectable effect on diversity. Trawling has been shown to reduce the abundance of bioturbating species, and the current study demonstrates important implications of this loss on the maintenance of diversity. In addition, the interactions between bioturbation, diversity and organic enrichment highlight the need for management of anthropogenic impacts within the coastal environment in a holistic way rather than by isolation.

Water samples were collected monthly, for a year, at 16 stations along the coast line between Brindisi and Santa Maria di Leuca. The results obtained described the heterotrophic bacterial community over an annual cycle. Mean values of bacterial densities were 5.3 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in Brindisi, 5.8 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in S. Cataldo. 4.3 x 10(1) CFUmI(-1) in Otranto and 6.7 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in S. M. di Leuca. The differences in bacterial densities between the sites considered were estimated. The hydrodynamic circulation, the trophism and the geographical position of the examined sites contribute to justify the different bacterial density trends. The bacterial community consisted mainly of the genera Aeromonas. Pseudonionas, Photobacterium and Flavobacterium. The Enterobacteriaceae represented a considerable fraction of the bacterial community in the Southern Adriatic Sea. Bacilli were predominant among the Gram positive bacteria. The enzymatic versatility of the observed genera suggest their importance in organic matter turnover of this oligotrophic ecosystem.

Previous studies in California have revealed that mechanical raking to remove wrack from sandy beaches has negative ecological consequences for coastal ecosystems. In the current study the presence and absence of eight common taxa that inhabit beached wrack on sandy beaches in Scotland was assessed at 60 sites, 24 of which were groomed and 29 of which were in receipt of a beach award. On average 4.86 of the eight taxa were found to be present on ungroomed beaches, whereas only 1.13 taxa were present on groomed beaches. Thus, beach grooming seems to be having a major effect on the biodiversity of beach macroinvertebrates in Scotland. Fewer macroinvertebrate taxa were also found on award (1.5) compared to non-award (4.38) beaches. It was also revealed that award beaches were much more likely to be groomed than non-award beaches, with 69% of award beaches surveyed being groomed compared to only 6% of non-award beaches. This pattern is surprising as the awarding bodies discourage the removal of seaweed and regulations state that beached wrack should only be removed if it constitutes a nuisance. It is concluded that award status, not nuisance level, has the main factor driving most beach grooming and that this has resulted in the substantial loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity from award beaches in Scotland. In conclusion it is shown that beach grooming has a substantial negative impact upon strandline macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Scotland and that grooming is much more likely to occur on award beaches.

Though limited to about 26% of the total land area of the country, maintaining healthy forests is vital to support sustainable development in Turkey. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the current status of Turkey's forests, present the national objectives for forest conservation and sustainable use. and describe the actions needed to protect forest biodiversity. While Turkey has numerous laws, regulations, and programmes that seek to promote biodiversity, implementation of these guidelines requires increased commitment and vigilance. Conservation programmes should be increased in number and effectiveness, particularly in light of increasing demand for forest products, Management plans for all conservation programmes require completion and implementation. Creating monitoring programs and building quantitative databases for conservation programs will be essential to assess future success in maintaining biodiversity. Conservation of natural resources requires public education and promoting awareness of the vital role of maintaining a healthy environment for sustainable development. Agroforestry endeavors can provide practical means of meeting both environmental protection and agricultural product production goals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we report the results of a recent national marine biodiversity inventory along the Swedish West coast between 2004 and 2009. The expedition revisited many historical localities that have been sampled with the same methods in the early twentieth century. We generated comparable datasets from our own investigation and the historical data to compare species richness, abundance, and geographic distribution of diversity. Our analysis indicates that the benthic ecosystems in the region have lost a large part of its original species richness over the last seven decades. We find evidence that especially rare species have disappeared. This process has caused a more homogenized community structure in the region and diminished historical biodiversity hotspots. We argue that the contemporary lack of rare species in the benthic ecosystems of the Kattegat and Skagerrak offers less opportunity to respond to environmental perturbations in the future and suggest improving the poor representation of rare species in the region. The study shows the value of biodiversity inventories as well as natural history collections in investigations of accumulated effects of anthropogenic activities and for re-establishing species-rich, productive, and resilient ecosystems.

Remains of amphibians, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, pterosaurs, dinosaurs and mammals have been recovered. The most common taxa are crocodylomorphs, and their most abundant remains are small isolated teeth. Six morphotypes have been identified, which may correspond to at least four different sympatric crocodylomorph taxa. This site presents a similar assemblage to other European Lower Cretaceous sites, with morphotypes that may correspond to the families Goniopholididae, Bernissartiidae, Atoposauridae and multiple ziphodont crocodylomorphs. The crocodylomorph assemblage of La Cantalera is characterized by the absence of large individuals and presents a wide variety of dental morphologies adapted to diets ranging from generalist to highly specialized. This rich biodiversity could be due to concentration of vertebrates into restricted flooded areas during dry seasons within a marsh ecosystem. Furthermore, La Cantalera could also be close to a nesting area, which would explain the abundance of small-sized individuals and the presence of fossil crocodiloid eggshells.

To address this issue, we examined the response of soil fauna (Collembola) to landscape heterogeneity at different spatial scales. We derived spatial features from satellite images of the Massif of Arize in the French Pyrenees. We developed a multiscale approach to test the effect of scale of the landscape pattern on species abundance and biodiversity, with a Mantel test and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, respectively. We distinguished the effect of the ""regional"" habitat (landscape descriptors) on soil fauna, which is a spatially explicit concept, and that of the ""local"" habitat (topography and forest type). We carried out a variance-partitioning analysis of species composition and richness to assess the relative contribution of regional and local habitat. The effect of the spatial structure on species abundance was especially strong at a well-defined scale of 48 ha. The surrounding environment that primarily structured the soil fauna assemblages was vegetation cover, measured as the mean of a radiometric vegetation index. Our results show that regional habitat can play an important role in structuring species composition, which is frequently hidden when the scale component is not taken into consideration. Further, we modeled endemic Collembolan richness based on a combination of landscape features at two spatial scales (2.25 ha and 292 ha). The landscape descriptors accounted for 72% of endemic richness variance, although within that variation 41% is shared with local habitat and spatial terms. We used the linear regression model to extrapolate endemism scores over the landscape. Such spatial models could be powerful tools for the selection and delimitation of high-biodiversity areas in conservation policies."

The best example of this threat is the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2. Several nonhuman primate species are endangered and might be in turn at risk of acquiring infection through human contacts, like poliovirus infection. Finally, interesting differences have been described in the degree of susceptibility to different viral agents between New World and Old World primates. For example, up to 40 different simian retroviruses have been identified infecting simians from the Old World but none has been found infecting New World primates. The study of viral infection in nonhuman primates is important for preserving biodiversity as well as to prevent epidemics with a significant impact on human health.

We examined the potential contributions of these areas to the conservation of biodiversity. Using GIS, we analyzed the concordance of inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) with ecoregion-scale biological importance and endangered and imperiled species distributions on a scale of 1:24,000. We found that more than 25% of IRAs are located in globally or regionally outstanding ecoregions and that 77% of inventoried roadless areas have the potential to conserve threatened, endangered, or imperiled species. IRAs would increase the conservation reserve network containing these species by 156%. We further illustrate the conservation potential of IRAs by highlighting their contribution to the conservation of the grizzly bear (Ursos arctos), a wide-ranging carnivore. The area created by the addition of IRAs to the existing system of conservation reserves shows a strong concordance with grizzly bear recovery zones and habitat range. Based on these findings, we conclude that IRAs belonging to the U.S. Forest Service are one of the most important biotic areas in the nation, and that their status as roadless areas could have lasting and far-reaching effects for biodiversity conservation.

Therefore, we need to identify conservation actions that can support biodiversity without taking land out of production. Previous studies suggest this can be accomplished by increasing ""farmland heterogeneity""-i.e. heterogeneity of the cropped portions of agricultural landscapes-by, for example, decreasing field sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether policies/guidelines that promote farmland heterogeneity will be as effective as those targeting farming practices. Here, we estimated the relative effects of six practices-annual/perennial crop, fertilizer use, herbicide use, insecticide use, tile drainage, and tillage-versus two aspects of farmland heterogeneity-field size and crop diversity-on the diversity of herbaceous plants, woody plants, butterflies, syrphid flies, bees, carabid beetles, spiders, and birds in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. The strength of effect of farming practices and farmland heterogeneity varied among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we found important effects of both farming practices and farmland heterogeneity on the combined (multi) diversity across these groups. In particular, we found greater multidiversity in untilled, perennial crop fields than tilled, annual crop fields, and greater multidiversity in agricultural landscapes with smaller crop fields and less diverse crops. The directions of effect of these variables were generally consistent across individual taxonomic groups. For example, richness was lower in landscapes with larger fields and more diverse crops than in landscapes with smaller fields and less diverse crops for all taxa except spiders. The negative effect of crop diversity on multidiversity and the richness of most of the studied taxa indicates that this aspect of farmland heterogeneity does not necessarily benefit wildlife species. Nevertheless, a compelling implication of this study is that it suggests that policies/guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes would be at least as effective for conservation of biodiversity within working agricultural landscapes as those designed to promote a wildlife-friendly farming practice."

4674	WOS:000251107000018	Biodiversity of earthworms in the levant	Israel Journal of Ecology & Evolution	01/01/2006	NA	4	Today, 37 species, 16 genera, and five families (Acanthodrilidae, Criodrilidae, Lumbricidae, Ocnerodrilidae, and Megascolecidae) of earthworms are known to be present in the Levant. Out of all recorded species, 35-43% (13-16 species) have been directly or indirectly introduced by humans and 57-65% (21-24 species) seem to be autochthonous. Twelve to fourteen (50-67%) autochthonous species are endemic to the Levant (genera Dendrobaena, Healyella, Helodrilus, and Perelia). The autochthonous Levantine earthworm fauna is exclusively Palearctic, and species mainly show zoogeographic affinities to Anatolia-Caucasus and Europe. No observed earthworm endemism above the species level corresponds to the expected origin of earthworm fauna in the Levant between Rupelian (30-28 Mya) and Tortonian (11.5-6 Mya) (Oligocene-Miocene). In spite of the fact that speciation in earthworms might take millions of years, the observed new species isolated in the desert oases and along the Negev and Sinai Desert borders might change this perception if we can differentiate between relicts surviving the expansion of the Arabo-Syrian desert belt and subsequent speciation.

We analysed three large datasets for the potential to predict the diversity of soil faunal groups from other parameters. The datasets represent different spatial scales, namely grassland nematodes on an European scale, forest collembola on a regional scale, and grassland ants on a local scale. We tested two groups of parameters as possible surrogates for species richness: (1) environmental parameters, such as climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, and (2) community parameters, such as higher taxon richness, indicator taxa, and maximum dominance. Climate and soil parameters were significantly correlated with biodiversity in all datasets. However, in spite of the large variety of measurement types analysed, prediction quality of environmental variables was weak and the explained proportion of variance ranged generally below 50%. Richness was subject to considerable stochastic variation among subsamples (CV = 20-60%) thereby evading a narrow correlation with environmental parameters. Higher taxon richness, based on taxa of intermediate hierarchical order, proved the best predictor of richness in collembola and nematodes explaining 55 and 89% of total variance, respectively. A combination of two ant species was the best predictor of ant richness explaining 59% of total variance. The authors conclude that a rough guess of soil faunal diversity can be cost-effectively derived from environmental data while an estimate of moderate quality can be obtained with reduced taxonomic effort. The precise richness of a soil community, however, is subject to autogeneous community dynamics, to biotic interactions with other populations, and to conditions in the past, and can therefore only be retrieved by immediate investigation of the community itself. Criteria for the quality of indicator parameters are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Because private land is being developed rapidly, there is heightened concern about identifying these areas. Although general principles on setting priorities for habitat protection are emerging, substantial ambiguity remains about how to implement these principles. Here, we offer a general modeling framework for evaluating how planning alternatives could affect Critical Habitat. The framework contains four components: stakeholder involvement, spatial modeling of Critical Habitat and development patterns, analysis of alternative scenarios, and evaluation and monitoring.

5775	WOS:000235096200014	Biodiversity - The appreciation of different thought styles and values helps to clarify the term	Restoration Ecology	01/03/2006	NA	22	"In restoration ecology the term biodiversity is widely used to define endpoints, to assess restoration needs, and to monitor restoration success. However, the term is far from clear because different uses of it result in ambiguities and misunderstandings. The appreciation of different thought styles, which are types of worldviews, and different values is crucial for a clearer and more consistent understanding of ""biodiversity."" Three groups of thought styles with different uses of the term biodiversity can be distinguished. (1) Natural history perceives biodiversity as biotic elements of nature that can be described and classified. (2) Science considers biodiversity as a measurable parameter that is relevant for ecosystem processes and functions. (3) In environmentalism, biodiversity is used in the context of concerns about species extinctions and habitat destructions. Values play a strong role in some perceptions of biodiversity but are negligible in others. Much confusion arises from some people considering biodiversity as something valuable per se and others seeing it as a virtually value-free parameter for the description of ecosystems. Because of different thought styles and values the term biodiversity should be used as a general concept, not as a specific element of nature. Biodiversity is a framework for the variety of life on Earth. Biodiversity in this sense is not measurable. However, specific features of biodiversity, e.g., the species richness of vascular plants, can be quantified. The selection of these features depends on thought styles and values. This implies that ""biodiversity as general concept"" should be distinguished from measurable ""features of biodiversity."" Explicit declarations of selected biodiversity features, in every case quantities are in the focus, are inevitable for an unambiguous use of the term."

Today's geography is, however, misleading and typical of only similar to 2% of the last million years; > 90% of that time the region's land area was 1.5-2.0 times larger as mean sea levels were 62 m below today's, climates were cooler, and extensive forests and savanna covered the emerged Sunda plains. The region's land area varied two-fold as sea levels fluctuated up to +/- 50 m with each of similar to 50 Pleistocene glacial cycles, and forests expanded and contracted with oscillations in land area and seasonality. This dynamic geographic history is relevant to the development of biogeographic regionalism and shows that it is today's forests that are refugial, not those of the Last Glacial Maximum. This history affects how species will adapt or shift their ranges in response to global warming and further decreases in land area (submergence of low-lying coastal areas) during the 21st century. The alternative is mass species extinction. The biota is also threatened by the continued destruction of forest, destruction of Mekong River flood-pulse based ecosystems, and continued human population growth. Human biogeography will become more important in conservation planning as tens of millions of people who depend on protected area forests, riverine ecosystems, and coastal habitats become environmental refugees. Conservation scientists need to become more involved in regional ecological education, environmental stewardship, and ecosystem-based adaptation to sustain as much as possible of this rich biota and the ecological services it provides.

We applied five methods (photocclectors, soil traps, shaking down, yellow dishes in low and high position) in three localities of Northern Bohemia in the birch forest at the same time and we compared quantitative and qualitative properties of heteropteran taxocoenosis. Qualitatively similar samples of communities were obtained from the photoeclector method and soil traps with the dominance of epigeic species and, further, from the methods of shaking down and yellow dishes. The effectivity of sampling methods was assessed using the rarefaction method revealing a high heteropteran species richness obtained by yellow dishes as compared with abundant samples from shaking down and photoeclectors. Biodiversity measures depend on the sampling method, the lowest were in the samples collected by shaking down, while the highest species diversity was recorded in the sample from yellow dishes. For a complex species richness and heterogeneity determination of true bug communities, even non-specialised methods for heteropterans sampling should be used.

Triazine herbicides constitute the main weed control in current conventional systems, but will be withdrawn under future EU guidelines. Here, we reappraise FSE data to predict effects of this withdrawal on invertebrate biodiversity under alternative management scenarios. Invertebrate indicators showed remarkably consistent and sensitive responses to weed abundance. Their numbers were consistently reduced by atrazine used prior to seedling emergence, but at reduced levels compared to similar observations for weeds. Large treatment effects were, therefore, maintained for invertebrates when comparing other conventional herbicide treatments with GMHT, despite reduced differences in weed abundance. In particular, benefits of GMHT remained under comparisons with best estimates of future conventional management without triazines. Pitfall trapped Collembola, seed-feeding carabids and a linyphiid spider followed closely trends for weeds and may, therefore, prove useful for modelling wider biodiversity effects of herbicides. Weaker responses to triazines applied later in the season, at times closer to the activity and capture of invertebrates, suggest an absence of substantial direct effects. Contrary responses for some suction-sampled Collembola and the carabid Loricera pilicornis were probably caused by a direct deleterious effect of triazines.

We conducted a literature review of species descriptions between January 1990 and August 2014. The following metadata were recorded from each article: year of publication, number of species, journal and impact factor, family(s) of the described species, number of authors, age of the authors and coauthors, country of the first author's institution and ecoregion of the type-locality. From accumulation of descriptions, we built an estimate model for number of species remaining to be described. We found 595 described species in 402 articles. The data demonstrated that there has been an increased understanding of the diversity of Siluriformes over the last 25 years in the Neotropical region, although 35% of the species still remain to be described. The model estimated that with the current trends and incentives, the biodiversity will be known in almost seven decades. We have reinforced the idea that greater joint efforts should be made by society and the scientific community to obtain this knowledge in a shorter period of time through enhanced programs for promoting science, training and the advancement of professionals before undiscovered species become extinct. The model built in this study can be used for similar estimates of other groups of animals.

Although most research has focused on present-day climate, a growing body of evidence indicates that modern ecological communities may be significantly shaped by paleoclimatic change and past anthropogenic factors. However, the generality of this pattern is unknown, as global analyses are lacking. Here we quantify the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of 515 tropical and subtropical large mammal communities and predict their structure from past and present climatic and anthropogenic factors. We find that the effects of Quaternary paleoclimatic change are strongest in the Afrotropics, with communities in the Indomalayan realm showing mixed effects of modern climate and paleoclimate. Malagasy communities are poorly predicted by any single factor, likely due to the atypical history of the island compared with continental regions. Neotropical communities are mainly codetermined by modern climate and prehistoric and historical human impacts. Overall, our results indicate that the factors governing tropical and subtropical mammalian biodiversity are complex, with the importance of past and present factors varying based on the divergent histories of the world's biogeographic realms and their native biotas. Consideration of the evolutionary and ecological legacies of both the recent and ancient past are key to understanding the forces shaping global patterns of present-day biodiversity and its response to ongoing and future abiotic and biotic changes in the 21st century.

A total of 75 nominal species have been described, among which several have become very popular among tropical fish hobbyists because of their tendency to form large schools of colourful individuals. Facing habitat loss and competition or predation by introduced species, this group has become a priority in the conservation of ornamental fishes in Indonesia. In this context, several expeditions have been conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Indonesian Papua with the aim to initiate a large-scale survey of the genetic resources in this group. We assessed the diversity of the Papua rainbowfishes with DNA barcoding. We sequenced the mitochondrial COI gene for 350 specimens belonging to 53 nominal species throughout the Indo-Australian archipelago. Unexpected levels of cryptic diversity and endemism were detected since additional cryptic lineages were detected in several watersheds from the Vogelkop and the Lengguru massif. DNA barcoding supports the presence of nearly 30 evolutionary lineages among the 15 nominal species sampled in the Vogelkop and all these lineages are endemic to a single lake or watershed. This result highlights that the diversity of the family has been largely underestimated and urges for the identification of conservation priorities in Papua.

A rugged territory and a long history of human settlement, combined with social and political isolation, have resulted in large areas with well-preserved forests, a large number of wild plant and animal species, and indigenous crops. Several factors, including agriculture expansion, intense logging activities, and oil and gas prospecting, are posing a threat to biodiversity. Current national parks and reserves are not enough to secure the survival of functional populations, especially of the large mammals. Conservation of biodiversity in the UBRB requires a broader approach: e.g, protection of the most sensitive areas outside present reserves; maintaining the remaining forest matrix under sustainable management regimes, involving the local communities in the process; and encouraging uses synergetic with conservation. Recent purchases by private enterprises of new protected areas, the willingness of local administrations to establish a new legal conservation framework, and local communities considering sustainable management of their lands, represent encouraging opportunities for the region.

Samples were taken at 10, 25, 50 and 90 in depth in each fjord. The total number of taxa recorded was 399 and the number of specimens 221,017, inclusive of ten juvenile taxa with 1265 specimens, collected from a told sampling area of 4.8 m(2). The number of taxa per station varied from 75 to 171, the density from 1790 to 8723 individuals m(-2), and the faunal diversity (Shannon-Wiener H') from 4.4 to 6.4. In general, the number of taxa increased with depth, whereas the highest densities were recorded at 10 and 25 in. The species richness was generally high at both small (alpha diversity) and larger (gamma diversity) spatial scales compared with other northern and off-shore shelf areas. Species turnover (beta diversity) was,greater across depths within fjords than within depths across fjords. Species community patterns were related to depth and sediment grain size. Statistical analyses undertaken indicated that the juveniles did not affect community structure very Much. Among the polychaetes and molluscs the proportion Of surface deposit feeders - inclusive of the both surface-feeding and suspensivorous Spionidae and Oweniidae - and the deep Subsurface deposit feeders (Maldanidae and the capitellid Heteromastus filiformis) largely increased with depth. The lowest proportion of other subsurface deposit feeders and the suspensivores occurred at the deepest stations. The study may provide useful reference data for sub-Arctic fjord enviroinments.

Extensive collections were performed throughout the estuary in five sampling campaigns during the summer and winter periods of 2012 and 2013 and summer of 2014, totalling 185 samples. About 49,000 organisms were analysed which together with the few previous records resulted in a total of 36 hydromedusae and three siphonophore species. We highlight the presence of Cnidostoma fallax in high abundance (>19,000 individuals captured; similar to 0% of all planktonic hydrozoans). The high abundance of this species throughout three consecutive summers suggests a change in the local assemblage structure, since previous reports in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s had shown Liriope tetraphylla recurrently as the dominant species which now ranks fourth. It is difficult to ascertain the causes of such changes due to the paucity of previous studies on Brazilian estuaries, but one possibility is that C. fallax has been recently introduced. In any case, the high dominance of this hydromedusa was not expected and this scenario would potentially cause changes in the local food web since C. fallax and L. tetraphylla are quite different morphologically and ecologically and thus probably play different trophic roles. Future studies are necessary to check the long-term permanency of C. fallax and to assess its biology and ecology and the impact of this assemblage change on the ecosystem.

We observed a high species turnover rate between the shelf and slope. The analysis of gastropod species distribution revealed a similar pattern on the shelf and slope and a large difference between shallow and deep-water faunas.

We suggest a methodology to derive a general relationship between biodiversity change and global warming. In conjunction with other pressure relationships, our relationship can help to assess the combined effect of different pressures to overall biodiversity change and indicate areas that are most at risk. We use a combination of an integrated environmental model ( IMAGE) and climate envelope models for European plant species for several climate change scenarios to estimate changes in mean stable area of species and species turnover. We show that if global temperature increases, then both species turnover will increase, and mean stable area of species will decrease in all biomes. The most dramatic changes will occur in Northern Europe, where more than 35% of the species composition in 2100 will be new for that region, and in Southern Europe, where up to 25% of the species now present will have disappeared under the climatic circumstances forecasted for 2100. In Mediterranean scrubland and natural grassland/steppe systems, arctic and tundra systems species turnover is high, indicating major changes in species composition in these ecosystems. The mean stable area of species decreases mostly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland/steppe systems and warm mixed forests.

However, over the last two decades harvesting of mangrove forests has been extensive with effects on mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. We investigate the effect of mangrove harvesting on tree biodiversity in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using two line transects each in ten mangrove forests, mangrove composition, species dominance, density, frequency, coverage, and stem diameter and diversity were recorded. Interviews detailing provisioning ecosystem services were also conducted with local forestry and fishery workers to determine the level of exploitation. Ten mangrove species were recorded (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba) belonging to six families (Avicenniaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Combretaceae, Arecaceae and Sonneratiaceae). Mangrove forests are now dominated by saplings and seedlings, with few trees above 15 cm diameter at breast height. Rhizophora sp. were found to be the most important and dominant species. Rhizophora sp. was the most widely used as it was deemed the most suitable for firewood and charcoal. In addition, it is the main species planted in mangrove restoration projects, which have focused on establishing production forest rather than restoring natural species composition and structure. Despite the decrease in biodiversity, the mangroves still provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the communities in the area.

Agricultural changes have been identified as a main driver of these declines. Although different agrienvironmental schemes have been implemented, their positive effect on biodiversity is relatively unknown. This raises the question as to how to reconcile farming production and biodiversity conservation to operationalize a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. We devised a bioeconomic model and conducted an analysis based on coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture. The coviability approach extended population viability analyses by including bioeconomic risk. Our model coupled stochastic dynamics of both biodiversity and farming land-uses selected at the microlevel with public policies at the macrolevel on the basis of financial incentives (taxes or subsidies) for land uses. The coviability approach made it possible for us to evaluate bioeconomic risks of these public incentives through the probability of satisfying a mix of biodiversity and economic constraints over time. We calibrated the model and applied it to a community of 34 common birds in metropolitan France at the small agricultural regions scale. We identified different public policies and scenarios with tolerable (0-0%) agroecological risk and modeled their outcomes up to 2050. Budgetary, economic, and ecological (based on Farmland Bird Index) constraints were essential to understanding the set of viable public policies. Our results suggest that some combinations of taxes on cereals and subsidies on grasslands could be relevant to develop a multifunctional agriculture. Moreover, the flexibility and multicriteria viewpoint underlying the coviability approach may help in the implementation of adaptive management.

This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil. Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down, litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape, grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil, grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not. Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity conservation value.

""Biodiversity prospecting'' - the search among naturally occurring organisms for new products of agricultural, industrial, and, particularly, pharmaceutical value - has been advanced as both a mechanism and a motive for conserving biological diversity. Economists and others have attempted to estimate the value of biodiversity for use in new pharmaceutical project research. In this paper we apply a new approach to estimating values: we employ two models of competition among differentiated products. Each model confirms previous findings that the value to private researchers of the ""marginal species'' is likely to be small. The models can have very different implications with respect to social values, however. These findings underscore the need for a better understanding of the true meaning of diversity."

Ecological Engineering	01/05/2017	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.02.062	10	"Wildflowers Wildflowers have an important environmental impact on rural biodiversity. Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the ""greening"" measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation.

In addition, topography is a complex factor, and the relationship between topography and biodiversity is still poorly understood. To understand the role of topography, i.e., altitude and slope, in biodiversity, we selected Jinggangshan Mountain (JGM), an area with unique topography, as the study area. We surveyed plant and animal species richness of JGM and compared the biodiversity and the main geographic characteristics of JGM with the adjacent 4 mountains. Gleason's richness index was calculated to assess the diversity of species. In total, 2958 spermatophyte species, 418 bryophyte species, 355 pteridophyte species and 493 species of vertebrate animals were recorded in this survey. In general, the JGM biodiversity was higher than that of the adjacent mountains. Regarding topographic characteristics, 77% of JGM's area was in the mid-altitude region and approximately 40% of JGM's area was in the 10 degrees-20 degrees slope range, which may support more vegetation types in JGM area and make it a biodiversity hotspot. It should be noted that although the impact of topography on biodiversity was substantial, climate is still a more general factor driving the formation and maintenance of higher biodiversity. Topographic conditions can create microclimates, and both climatic and topographic conditions contribute to the formation of high biodiversity in JGM.

Three broad groups of indicators are defined: (1) resource use indicators representing pressures on the environment; (2) resource efficiency indicators relating resource use indicators to the socio-economic side; and (3) environmental impact indicators linking resource use impacts on the state of the natural system. Based on this conceptual framework we develop a structure for possible resource efficiency indicators and conduct a RACER evaluation on the Relevance, Acceptance, Credibility, Easiness and Robustness of indicators. With the RACER evaluation, we identify areas where indicators are well established and available as well as areas where indicators still need further development or even need to be designed first.

Small islands hold a disproportionately large amount of the worlds threatened biodiversity but it is among the least well-documented. This paper reports on the most extensive collation and synthesis of biodiversity data to date for the 14 United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs). A process of literature review and consultation produced 65,259 species records, including 32,216 native species of which 1549 were endemic to a single UKOT. The extent of knowledge of species occurrence varied both between islands and taxonomic groups. It was higher for vertebrates and vascular plants than small bodied invertebrates and non-vascular and for non-Caribbean compared to Caribbean islands, a difference that largely reflects knowledge of invertebrates. Global Red List assessments exist for 2606 species and document 111 of endemic species, 75 % of those assessed, and 291, 12 % of non-endemics, as globally threatened. Using the data to estimate true species richness suggests a further 70,000 native species, including 1800 single island endemics, remain to be documented suggesting the UKOTs as a whole may support over 100,000 native species including 3300 single island endemics.

This work aims to fill in this knowledge gap by exploring the modelling potential of nine Baltic Sea ecosystem models to support this specific European policy and, in particular, models' capabilities to inform on marine biodiversity. Several links are found between the Model-Derived Indicators and some of the relevant biodiversity-related descriptors (i.e. biological diversity and food webs), and pressures (i.e. interference with hydrological processes, nutrient and organic matter enrichment and marine acidification). However several gaps remain, in particular in the limited representation of habitats other than the pelagic that the models are able to address for descriptor sea-floor integrity and inability to assess descriptor non-indigenous species. The general outcome is that the Baltic Sea models considered do not adequately cover all the requested needs of the MSFD, but can potentially do so to a certain extent, while for some descriptors/criteria/indicators/pressures new indicators and/or modelling techniques need to be developed in order to satisfactorily address the requirement of the MSFD and assess the environmental status of the Baltic Sea.

Species richness in the sweep net samples was low in 2 lakes with recent ecological perturbations and the highest in one oligotrophic lake. Species diversity was the lowest in 2 eutrophicated lakes and generally higher in the oligotrophic lakes. The biodiversity values in sediment assemblages showed trends similar to those in the sweep net samples; the lowest values were observed in one of the eutrophic lakes and the highest in the oligotrophic lakes. It is likely that the observed differences were due to the impact of nutrients on the development of littoral vegetation and consequently chydorid habitats and resources. The role of nutrients as a forcing mechanism on chydorid biodiversity was indicated by high and significant negative correlations between species diversity in both total phosphorus and sweep net and sediment samples. The comparison between biodiversity in the 2 sample types showed that the biodiversity values were almost consistently higher in the surface sediment assemblages than in the sweep net samples, suggesting that surface sediment analysis provides an effective alternative method to living material examination for biodiversity evaluations.

6250	WOS:000252966500014	Argentine ants displace floral arthropods in a biodiversity hotspot	Diversity and Distributions	01/03/2008	10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00410.x	62	Argentine ant (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) invasions are often associated with the displacement of ground-dwelling arthropods. Argentine ant invasions can also exert other effects on the community through interactions with plants and their associated arthropods. For example, carbohydrate resources (e.g. floral or extrafloral nectar) may influence foraging behaviour and interactions among ants and other arthropods. In South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, Argentine ants and some native ant species are attracted to the floral nectar of Leucospermum conocarpodendron Rourke (Proteaceae), a native tree that also has extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited inflorescences more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging was influenced by the EFNs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to inflorescences with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to ant-excluded inflorescences. Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75% less time foraging on inflorescences with Argentine ants than on inflorescences without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to inflorescences had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen-limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the inflorescences, but did not differ among inflorescences visited by native and Argentine ants. Displacement of arthropods appears to be a consistent consequence of Argentine ant invasions. The displacement of floral arthropods by Argentine ants may have far-reaching consequences for this biodiversity hotspot and other regions that are rich in insect-pollinated plants.

Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30 degrees 41' N; 90 degrees 29' W), eastern Louisiana (USA). Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m(2) plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades. Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m(2), 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and short-lived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition. Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species.

The model revealed an important influence of seasonally anomalous weather on fire probability, with increased probability of fire in seasons that are warmer and drier than average. In addition to these local-scale influences, the Antarctic Ocean Oscillation (AAO) was identified as an important large-scale influence or teleconnection to global circulation patterns. Fire probability increased in seasons during positive AAO phases, when the subtropical jet moves northward and low level moisture transport decreases. These results confirm that fire occurrence in the CFR is strongly affected by climatic variability at both local and global scales, and thus likely to respond sensitively to future climate change. Comparison of the modelled fire probability between two periods (1951-1975 and 1976-2000) revealed a 4-year decrease in an average fire return time. If, as currently forecasted, climate change in the region continues to produce higher temperatures, more frequent heat waves, and/or lower rainfall, our model thus indicates that fire frequency is likely to increase substantially. The regional implications of shorter fire return times include shifting community structure and composition, favoring species that tolerate more frequent fires. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, data about their abundance and diversity, and information about the criteria used for the species selection, are still limited. Besides providing a historical overview, we analyze and compare data on abundance, diversity and criteria of species selection of street trees in 15 Italian cities chosen considering their representativeness along a bioclimatic transect across Italy. The biodiversity of urban street trees resulted quite rich with 277 species (about 60% are exotic); among these, Platanus x hispanica Mill. ex Munchh., Celtis australis L. and Quercus ilex L. resulted as the most common species. Besides the general suitability for the local climatic conditions, several factors seem to concur in the species selection, such as their aesthetic appeal and dimension. Other selection criteria based on the species' ecology or functionality were not evident.

Economic forces are recognized as an important driving factor behind current biodiversity losses. This study investigates whether such factors have been important in determining one measure of biodiversity change over the 'long run' - in our case, 400 years - for upland sites in Scotland. 2. A combination of palaeoecological, historical and economic methods is used to construct and then analyse a database of factors contributing to changes in plant diversity over time for 11 upland sites. 3. Using an instrumental variables panel model, we find livestock prices, our proxy for grazing pressure, to be a statistically significant determinant of diversity change, with higher grazing pressures resulting in lower diversity values on average, although site abandonment is also found to result in a fall in plant diversity. Technological change, such as the introduction of new animal breeds, was not found to be a statistically significant determinant. 4. Using later period data (post 1860) on livestock numbers at the parish (local) level, we were able to confirm the main result noted above (3) in terms of the effects of higher grazing pressures on plant diversity. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how data from very different disciplines can be combined to address questions relevant to contemporary conservation and understanding. This novel, interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the role of economic factors as a driver of biodiversity loss in the uplands. Biodiversity levels have varied considerably over 400 years, partly as a function of land management, suggesting that establishing baselines or 'natural' target levels for biodiversity is likely to be problematic. Changes in livestock grazing pressures brought about by changes in prices had statistically significant effects on estimated plant diversity, as did land abandonment. This suggests that long-term management of upland areas for the conservation of diversity should focus on grazing pressures as a key policy attribute. Another policy implication is that drastic cuts in grazing pressures - such as might occur under current reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy - can have adverse biodiversity consequences.

The Moor Cliffs Formation contains several fine-grained tuff horizons that act as regional markers for correlation, three of these are substantial in thickness (0.5-4 m), laterally persistent and contain abundant trace fossils. The tuffs record sudden volcanic events associated with the convergence of Avalonia with Laurentia, possibly accompanied by tsunami. The trace fossils preserved on the tops of individual falls include the locally profuse development of ovoid faecal pellets in close association with the tops of trumpet-shaped burrows. Surfaces also preserve arthropod locomotion and foraging traces (Palmichnium antarcticum, Diplopodichnus biformis, rare Cruziana sp., and bilobed trails). Vertical and horizontal burrows (Beaconites antarcticus) are common. Other traces found are microbially generated wrinkle marks (mat grounds) and ""cauliflower"" structures. Traces in the tuffs record a greater diversity of faunal activity than that observed in the encasing dryland environment sediments and indicate a possible preservational bias provided by deposition of the air fall tuffs or colonization of the tuff deposits by opportunist populations following phytoplankton blooms associated with the volcanic events. They remain the main indicators of biodiversity in this relatively fossil-poor continental stratigraphic interval. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This is overall true when considering global scales, since human-induced global change is expected to make significant changes on the Earth's biota. Biodiversity management and planning is mainly based on field observations related to community diversity, considering different taxa. However, such methods are time and cost demanding and do not allow in most cases to get temporal replicates. In this view, remote sensing can provide a wide data coverage in a short period of time. Recently, the use of Rao's Q diversity as a measure of spectral diversity has been proposed in order to explicitly take into account differences in a neighbourhood considering abundance and relative distance among pixels. The aim of this paper was to extend such a measure over the temporal dimension and to present an innovative approach to calculate remotely sensed temporal diversity. We demonstrated that temporal beta-diversity (spectral turnover) can be calculated pixel-wise in terms of both slope and coefficient of variation and further plotted over the whole matrix / image. From an ecological and operational point of view, for prioritisation practices in biodiversity protection, temporal variability could be beneficial in order to plan more efficient conservation practices starting from spectral diversity hotspots in space and time. In this paper, we delivered a highly reproducible approach to calculate spatio-temporal diversity in a robust and straightforward manner. Since it is based on open source code, we expect that our method will be further used by several researchers and landscape managers.

The greatest number of taxa was revealed in the south, southeast, and north of the Barents Sea. The average number of taxa in the sample was at a maximum off the coast of the Svalbard Archipelago. The greatest value of the Shannon index was registered within the Murmansk coastal water mass (Barents Sea) and Svalbard Archipelago. The median values of the evenness of the abundance of fauna were 0.5-0.6. A trend to a reduction of the biodiversity parameters of zooplankton communities with increasing square of water area water area was found. An inverse correlation between the Shannon and evenness indices for the total zooplankton abundance was revealed.	Dvoretsky, V. G. ; Dvoretsky, A.

Nonetheless, sublittoral mussel beds on rocky shores have rarely been examined in a patch context to determine the processes creating and maintaining the diversity and assemblages of organisms occupying them. Whereas the species-area relationship is a well-established theory in ecology, less is known about its effect on faunal compositions in aquatic habitats. Also, the effect of patch shape and relative patch edge are poorly studied within a rocky shore mussel framework. The present study examined the effects of blue mussel patch size, patch shape, and the presence of algae and sand in mussel patches on the composition and diversity of associated macrofaunal communities in sublittoral habitats. In line with the species-area relationship, we found that the total number of taxa increased with patch size up to ca. 500 cm(2), thereafter declining. Small patches largely lacked annelid worms and showed a lower diversity of gastropod species. We also found that the diversity was further enhanced by a high biomass of blue mussels, the presence of algae and the weight of interstitial sand. The shape of the patch had no effect on species richness, but affected the species composition. We conclude that structural components of sublittoral blue mussel habitats, such as patch content and shape, greatly affect the diversity and faunal assemblage. This has important implications in conservation biology, since habitats are becoming more fragmented. Our study demonstrates that not only habitat quantity, but also quality has a large impact on species communities in marine ecosystems.

Biodiversity of farm animals and plants gives the foundation to food production that ensures the existence and future of contemporary civilizations. Rapid economic development, unfortunately, does not facilitate the preservation of biodiversity and organisms characterised by many desirable properties and features are perishing. Economic progress forces humans to abandon traditional, safe and more varied species, and to switch to monocultures and those non-native to specific habitats, but which are more productive. In this way mankind had lost forever a large part of this living deposit of the past times, and this process continues. Probably, in some cases, this results simply from the pure ignorance of local keepers concerning traditional varieties and breeds. Therefore, it is worth promoting and encouraging the efforts of both individuals and institutions in terms of a better understanding of this subject, and to seek support in the interests of present and future mankind.

While several approaches of nature protection have been applied to the terrestrial domain, aquatic biotopes frequently still lack a good ecological state as required by EU policies (WFD and MSFD). For numerous years, the underwater world has been considered as one sphere and was neglected in the development of distinctive concepts of conservation for its variety of biotopes. This paper's objective is the enhancement of ecological connectivity within the study area through the design of benthic wildlife corridors and a consequent sublittoral biotope network. A step-by-step approach is presented for the optimization of ecological potential in heavily modified coastal water bodies, using Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea) as a case study. The procedure for the development of wildlife corridors includes defining and mapping of existing biotope types, the identification of key species for each biotope type and delineating their mobility range, the reconstruction of near-natural / pre-industrial conditions and deriving the protection priorities by comparing past with current / modified conditions. By harmonizing these scientific insights with the local land use of human society, proposals for biotope restoration and improvements can be made. In Kiel Fjord, compensation measures, obligatory for human interventions, such as construction work in the marine environment in this case, have been implemented and present an opportunity to enhance the connectivity of biotopes, thus creating wildlife corridors for their inhabitants. The composition of benthic wildlife corridors, forming a sublittoral biotope network in accordance with the present anthropogenic uses, holds potential for implementation in comparably altered coastal water bodies and integration into national and international frameworks, in anticipation of its functionality.

This requires calculating the biodiversity trends in nations, whereas previously, most academic research on quantifying biodiversity concerned communities within relatively small sites. We consider design and analysis issues that CBD targets raise and explore the potential pitfalls for managers of monitoring schemes when statistical principles yield to practical constraints. We list five main criteria that well-designed monitoring programmes should meet: representative sampling locations, sufficient sample size, sufficient detections of target species, a representative sample of species, and a sound temporal sampling scheme. We examine the implications of biodiversity assessments that fail to meet these criteria and suggest ways to alleviate these implications through analytical approaches. We discuss the remarkable potential for wide-scale biodiversity monitoring offered by technological advances and by the rise of citizen science.	Buckland, S.

The protectorate contains religious and culturally significant sites, including Mount Sinai and the Monastery of Saint Katherine. Seven thousand bedouin from six tribes live in or around the protectorate. Recent development pressure, catalysed by tourism, has resulted in the natural resource base of this fragile region being overexploited. An integrated management plan is under development to conserve the area's natural and cultural heritage, and ensure community participation while expanding opportunities for sustainable tourism.

Biological Conservation	01/02/2014	10.1016/j.biocon.2013.10.009	18	Riparian forests are biodiversity hotspots and key habitats for forest conservation, yet it is not known if the protection of these habitats also provides protection for stream organisms. We used data from 50 headwater stream-forest systems in northern Finland to address this question. Our study sites formed a gradient from highly modified (by forestry) to old-growth riparian forests. We assessed whether the community structure and diversity of benthic diatoms, aquatic bryophytes, stream macroinvertebrates and red-listed species (bryophytes + invertebrates) responded to riparian habitat alteration and whether habitat classification based on site naturalness is indicative of stream conservation value. Except for diatoms and chironomid larvae, all taxonomic groups studied, as well as red-listed species, responded negatively to site modification, showing peak diversity in unmodified habitats. Also in terms of community composition, most aquatic groups responded to the gradient of site naturalness. These results suggest that woodland key habitats, although initially targeted at the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity, may prove to be valuable for the protection of stream biodiversity as well, extending their potential importance to regional biodiversity conservation.

Currently, we lack an understanding of the threat of N deposition to biodiversity at the global scale. In particular, rates of N deposition within the newly defined 34 world biodiversity hotspots, to which 50% of the world's floristic diversity is restricted, has not been quantified previously. Using output from global chemistry transport models, here we provide the first estimates of recent (mid-1990s) and future (2050) rates and distributions of N deposition within biodiversity hotspots. Our analysis shows that the average deposition rate across these areas was 50% greater than the global terrestrial average in the mid-1990s and could more than double by 2050, with 33 of 34 hotspots receiving greater N deposition in 2050 compared with 1990. By this time, 17 hotspots could have between 10% and 100% of their area receiving greater than 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), a rate exceeding critical loads set for many sensitive European ecosystems. Average deposition in four hotspots is predicted to be greater than 20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). This elevated N deposition within areas of high plant diversity and endemism may exacerbate significantly the global threat of N deposition to world floristic diversity. Overall, we highlight the need for a greater global approach to assessing the impacts of N deposition.

However, studies have barely investigated how the evolutionary dependence of species traits affects EF. Here, we developed an integrated approach combining functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) into a single space to disentangle the effects of diversity on leaf decomposition. We conducted an experiment manipulating plant leaves into litterbags containing four species (from a pool of 27) combined in four different treatments represented by low or high FD and PD; these treatments present different scenarios of trait evolution and, therefore, a treatment with high FD and low PD, for instance, mimics a community assembled by divergent trait evolution of close relatives. We found that leaf decomposition was 30% slower in pools with high FD and PD. We show species pool with higher FD and PD have non-additive effects on decomposition, which means there is a negative effect of mixtures combining species with great functional and evolutionary differences. In addition, interactive effects of PD and FD were more important to leaf decomposition than their isolated effects. Our results suggest that PD and FD have interactive effects on decomposition and represent different axes of ecosystem variation, indicating we should avoid using phylogenies as a proxy for functional diversity. We argue that future BEF experiments may alter their design by considering a multifaceted scenario investigating community effects on ecosystem functioning, and idiosyncratic effects of key traits which may determine community assembly and ecosystem processes.

However, some current European agri-environment schemes seem to be rather ineffective. A likely explanation is the lack of source populations in intensely cultivated landscapes. Remnants of natural and seminatural habitats can contribute to regional biodiversity in various ways: as essential habitats for specialised species, as stepping stones, and as temporary habitats for hibernation, larval development, or preovipository feeding. The overall percentage of arthropod species, for which seminatural habitats are an essential prerequisite for living in an agricultural landscape, was assessed with a 5 km long transect of 18 standardised trapping stations. The transect extended from an isolated area of wetland through intensely managed crop fields and grassland to an isolated semiarid meadow bordered by mixed forest. For more than 1000 arthropod species the spatial and temporal distribution of a one year's catch along the transect was interpreted with regard to their affinity to seminatural habitats. Experts were asked to judge questionable cases of apparent ubiquist species. All in all, more than 63% of all animal species (except for soil and water fauna) living in the agriculturally managed areas of the Limpach valley seem to depend on the presence of seminatural habitats. We conclude that remnant islands of natural or seminatural habitats provide the most important source populations for agri-environment schemes in order to enhance biodiversity in an otherwise depleted agricultural landscape.

Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.

Currently, these areas are under threat due to human activities such as unsustainable and destructive fishing practices, environmental phenomena, and other significant pressures related to global environmental change. The coralligenous habitats are also endangered by practices that result in the presence of abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) at sea, a worldwide phenomenon only recently stigmatized whose impacts on marine habitats and coralligenous areas are serious. The aim of this paper is to investigate the economic value of restoration strategies promoted to safeguard and improve biodiversity in these coralligenous habitats through a contingent valuation survey administered to a sample of 4000 Italians. Households' willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity restoration and conservation ranges between sic10.30 and sic64.02 depending on the assumptions underlying the different models. The main positive and significant determinants of WTP are a previous knowledge or familiarity with coralligenous habitats and biodiversity issues, income, education, environmental attitudes, and the knowledge that indiscriminate fishing may be dangerous for biodiversity in a coralligenous habitat.

Here, we present a theoretical framework to evaluate food-web complexity in terms of biodiversity. Food network unfolding is a theoretical method to transform a complex food web into a linear food chain based on ecosystem processes. Based on this method, we can define three biodiversity indices, horizontal diversity (D-H), vertical diversity (D-V) and range diversity (D-R), which are associated with the species diversity within each trophic level, diversity of trophic levels, and diversity in resource use, respectively. These indices are related to Shannon's diversity index (H'), where H' = D-H + D-V - D-R. Application of the framework to three riverine macroinvertebrate communities revealed that D indices, calculated from biomass and stable isotope features, captured well the anthropogenic, seasonal, or other within-site changes in food-web structures that could not be captured with H' alone.

The connectivity analysis presented here explores the numbers and patterns of corridors required to connect urban green spaces as part of an overall biodiversity conservation strategy. Green spaces in this study were weighted based on size and a habitat requirement of 0.5 ha for a hypothetical indicator species. Thirteen potential networks were evaluated using Gamma, Beta, and Cost Ratio indices. The study zone contained 54 green spaces (habitat nodes) with a combined area of 636.5 ha in a total urban area of approximately 2,600 ha. Several models (Travelling Salesman, Paul Revere, and Least Cost to User) were used to evaluate possible connections. These results indicated that at least 325 linkages are necessary to connect half of the nodes. Such large numbers of linkages are only feasible by enhancing the matrix of backyard habitat, planted boulevards, and utility rights-of way found in a city. Strengthening such networks should work well to support the biota protected in urban parks and wildlife refuges and the seasonal migrants that sometimes depend on urban habitats for their survival.

Termites play a key role in decomposition processes in tropical ecosystems. Rapid assessment of local termite assemblages requires a standardized sampling protocol capable of producing an accurate picture of species composition. This paper evaluates the efficacy of a sampling protocol designed to assess termite species richness and functional diversity in tropical forests. 2. The protocol entails a 100 m long transect consisting of 20 sections (each 5 x 2 m). One hour of human sampling effort per section is used to search for and collect termites from dead wood, soil, termite nests and other microhabitats up to a height of 2 m above ground. The protocol was tested in three forest sites where the local termite fauna was already comprehensively documented. Two transects were run at Danum Valley (Sabah, Borneo), one at Pasoh Forest Reserve (Peninsular Malaysia) and one at Mbalmayo Forest Reserve (Cameroon). 3. At the three sites the transect samples contained 31-36% of the known local termite species pool. The taxonomic and functional group composition of the transect samples did not differ significantly from that of the known local fauna. The two transects run at Danum Valley gave very similar patterns, suggesting that the protocol produces consistent within-site results. After sampling 20 sections, pseudoturnover between the two Danum transects had declined to a relatively low level. 4. The transect method is effective because it utilizes collecting expertise within a protocol that standardizes sampling effort and area. The protocol provides a much more rapid and cost-effective method for studying termite assemblage structure than sampling regimes designed to estimate population abundances. It was demonstrated that one supervised training transect was sufficient to ensure the protocol was conducted with the required level of sampling efficiency. 5. The protocol offers a rapid tool for investigating spatial and temporal patterns of termite assemblage structure in tropical forest sites. Existing data also suggest that termites warrant further investigation as ecological indicators. Termite assemblage composition shows a strong response to habitat disturbance and may be indicative of quantitative changes in the decomposition process. The termite transect has potential as a useful addition to any suite of organisms recommended for monitoring functional processes in tropical forests.

This paper aims to (1) elucidate the historical discovery rate of endemic southern African marine fishes and (2) to estimate the number of potentially undescribed endemic marine fishes in the region using a statistical model and which factors (e.g. size/depth) contribute to unknown diversity. Thirdly, all species described globally for eight families (Blennidae, Clinidae, Gobiidae, Lutjanidae, Rajidae, Sciaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Sparidae) were analysed to elucidate unknown diversity in these groups. Location The oceans of southern Africa, including Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique, encompassing sections of the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Indian Ocean. Methods Literature surveys from a number of sources were carried out to compile lists of species descriptions from 1758 onwards. Species-accumulation curves were plotted for all endemic species, as well as for different components of size and depth. A maximum likelihood model was used to estimate the number of undescribed endemic marine fishes in southern Africa, as well as for all other categories, including global families. Results Fish discovery rates in southern Africa have varied with time. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of the total endemic fish fauna remain unknown and that size is the greatest predictor of whether a fish has been described. Smaller-sized fishes and those inhabiting shallow areas are most likely to be undersampled. It is likely that most undescribed fishes inhabit the subtropical/tropical waters of the east coast. Main conclusions At the current rate of fish description, it will take at least 50 years to describe the total endemic fish fauna. However, estimates of unknown species are probably higher because of cryptic species within currently recognized taxa. Climate change may also contribute to range expansions of marine species, further complicating the status of endemicity in southern African marine fishes.	von der Heyden, Sophie	1	711891	South Africa	biodiversity ; marine fishes ; maximum likelihood estimates of marine biodiversity ; southern africa ; species-accumulation curves	2011	Fernando Urbano	yes	Afrotropical	Eastern Atlantic ocean (Namibia/South Africa) and western Indian Ocean (South Africa/Mozambique)	NA	Saltwater	Coastal waters	Big data ; Review/Opinion	0	0	Literature surveys, species-accumulation curves, maximum likelihood model	Marine fish biodiversity	1	1	1	Southern Africa marine fishes	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA

Although statutes in the U.S. may require consideration of biodiversity in local land-use planning and regulation, local governments lack the data, resources, and expertise to routinely consider biotic impacts that result from permitted land uses. We hypothesized that decision support systems could aid solution of this problem. We developed a pilot biodiversity expert systems tool (BEST) to test that hypothesis and learn what additional scientific and technological advancements are required for broad implementation of such a system. BEST uses data from the U.S. Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (GAP) and other data in a desktop GIS environment. The system provides predictions of conflict between proposed land uses and biotic elements and is intended for use at the start of the development review process. Key challenges were the development of categorization systems that relate named land-use types to ecological impacts, and relate sensitivities of biota to ecological impact levels. Although the advent of GAP and sophisticated desktop GIS make such a system feasible for broad implementation, considerable ongoing research is required to make the results of such a system scientifically sound, informative, and reliable for the regulatory process. We define a role for local government involvement in biodiversity impact assessment, the need for a biodiversity decision support system, the development of a prototype system, and scientific needs for broad implementation of a robust and reliable system.

Thus, there is a great need to understand just what ""valuing"" biodiversity or species really means, e.g. regarding how many and which species are important in providing ecosystem services or other values. Constructing ecosystem-level indices, however, requires weighting the relative contribution of species to the different values. Using farmland birds, we illustrate how species contribute to different biodiversity values, namely utilitarian (pest seed predation potential), cultural (species occurrence in poetry), conservational (declines and rarity) and inherent (all species equal) value. Major contributions to each value are often made by a subset of the community and different species are important for different values, leading to no correlations or, in some cases, negative correlations between species' relative contributions to different values. Our results and methods using relative contributions of species to biodiversity values can aid decisions when weighing different values in policies and strategies for natural resource management. We conclude that acknowledging the importance of the range of biodiversity values that are apparent from different perspectives is critical if the full value of biodiversity to society is to be realised."

Impression and compression data suggest that the flora in the Tiaojishan Formation is dominated by Bermettitales, ferns and Nilssoniales, followed by ginkgophytes; conifers and sphenopsids are less common. Abundant permineralized rhizomes are referable to diverse taxa within fern families such as Osmundaceae and Cyatheaceae. Abundant and upright fossil stumps are common in the Tiaojishan Formation. They are welt preserved with distinct growth rings and are predominatly conifers. The floristic signature of the Tiaojishan Formation indicates that subtropical to temperate warm and humid climates prevailed during the late Middle Jurassic in the Beipiao area. Growth ring pattern analysis of the fossil conifer wood demonstrates a consistent and distinct seasonal climate during this interval. The biodiversity of the remarkable Tiaojishan flora provides essential evidence for understanding the vegetation, pataeoclimate and environmental evolution of western Liaoning during the Middle to Late Jurassic.

The widely accepted paradigm of increasing biodiversity towards the tropics does not seem to be valid for macroalgal floras of the Southern Hemisphere. We compiled a database summarizing the distributional ranges of macroalgae along the coast of Argentina to test whether biodiversity decreases towards lower latitudes, as in the Pacific coast of South America, and whether breaking points in the geographical distribution can be recognized in one or more areas of the Southwest Atlantic south of 36 degrees S. We found a clear trend of decreasing biodiversity with decreasing latitude. The interpretation of some biodiversity declines is confounded by changes in the intensity of the sampling effort. A 51% reduction in algal species richness between 42 and 41 degrees S coincides with the boundary between the Argentine and Magellanic Zoogeographic Provinces. This sharp breaking point is related to a thermal anomaly caused by long residence times of water masses within San Matias Gulf, suggesting an upper thermal tolerance limit for most Antarctic/sub-Antarctic seaweeds. A further reduction occurs at 38-37 degrees S. This breaking point can be explained by the disappearance of suitable hard substrata, since rocky outcrops give place to wide extensions of sandy beaches. The impoverished algal assemblage inhabiting the northern coast of Argentina is mainly related to the reduction or disappearance of the Antarctic/sub-Antarctic floristic component. This area is characterised by a predominance of widely distributed species, Chlorophytes and opportunistic filamentous or foliose algae.

An exemplar for the development of distributed information networks in Europe	Aquatic Conservation-Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems	01/08/2008	10.1002/aqc.950	2	1. Transitional waters are ecosystems of special importance for a number of reasons and require effective management. In Greece, biodiversity and environmental data that help to manage these ecosystems do exist, although they are scattered and not easily accessible. An overarching, publicly accessible system combining all kinds of information has not been available until now. 2. The ElNet system was developed to serve these requirements. The system is a functional application consisting of a comprehensive database and an online interface with an interactive map, and search capabilities for biological and environmental data on Greek transitional waters. Nine datasets have already been integrated and are available online. Data and their metadata are documented and checked for quality to allow comparisons and reduce bias in resulting analyses. 3. The data assembled cover a broad geographical and temporal range, allowing large-scale analyses of transitional waters. These in turn produce new scientific knowledge and provide a sound basis of information for scientists, environmental managers and policy-makers. 4. Examination of the data revealed an overall insufficient quality control practice during data acquisition and digitization. A good data management and archive system can significantly improve the quality of data. To encourage scientists to submit their data to a data management centre a clear data policy document regulating rights and duties could form an incentive for data sharing. 5. Results from;l Case study carried out oil the macrobenthic inventories of the lagoonal Systems included ill the system demonstrate the potential use of this simple type of information by environmental managers and scientists. 6. The system. still in its initial phase. will be improved by integrating new datasets and developing tools for data retrieval and analyses.

1586	WOS:000173303600001	Biodiversity in the Phanerozoic: a reinterpretation	Paleobiology	01/09/2001	NA	244	Many features of global diversity compilations have proven robust to continued sampling and taxonomic revision. Inherent biases in the stratigraphic record may nevertheless substantially affect estimates of global taxonomic diversity. Here we focus on short-term (epoch-level) changes in apparent diversity. We use a simple estimate of the amount of marine sedimentary rock available for sampling: the number of formations in the stratigraphic Lexicon of the United States Geological Survey. We find this to be positively correlated with two independent estimates of rock availability: global outcrop area derived from the Paleogeographic Atlas Project (University of Chicago) database, and percent continental flooding. Epoch-to-epoch changes in the number of formations are positively correlated with changes in sampled Phanerozoic marine diversity at the genus level. We agree with previous workers in finding evidence of a diversity-area effect that is substantially weaker than the effect of the amount of preserved sedimentary rock. Once the mutual correlation among change in formation numbers, in diversity, and in area flooded is taken into consideration, there is relatively little residual correlation between change in diversity and in the extent of continental flooding. These results suggest that much of the observed short-term variation in marine diversity may be an artifact of variation in the amount of rock available for study. Preliminary results suggest the same possibility for terrestrial data. Like the comparison between change in number of formations and change, in sampled diversity, which addresses short-term variation in apparent diversity, the comparison between absolute values of these quantities, which relates to longer-term patterns, also shows a positive correlation. Moreover, there is no clear temporal trend in the residuals of the regression of sampled diversity on number of formations. This raises the possibility that taxonomic diversity may not have increased substantially since the early Paleozoic. Because of limitations in our data, however, this question must remain open.

REDD+ policies present prospective win-win solutions for climate change mitigation, rural development and biodiversity conservation. Notably, protecting, enhancing and restoring forests for their carbon sequestration services has the potential to additionally promote the conservation of imperiled tropical biodiversity. However, it has become increasingly apparent that efforts to design a REDD+ mechanism that optimizes emissions reductions and associated co-benefits face significant environmental and economic trade-offs. We provide a framework for conceptualizing the major related policy options, presenting the associated trade-offs as a continuum and as functions of two key factors: (1) geographic targeting, and (2) the selection of specific forest management activities. Our analysis highlights the challenges of assessing trade-offs using existing data and valuation schemes, and the difficulty of paying for and legislating biodiversity co-benefits and safeguards within a future REDD+ mechanism.

We found 125 species of galling insects on 80 host plant species. The increase of plant species richness explained 35% of the variation in galling insect richness, corroborating the plant species richness hypothesis. Most of the galling species occurred on trees, followed by shrubs, and herbs. However, the difference in mean number of galls was only statistically significant between herbs and trees, corroborating partially the plant structural complexity hypothesis. A significant relationship was observed between galling species richness and density of herbs, and shrubs, corroborating partially the resource concentration hypothesis. Galling insect richness showed a negative correlation with magnesium, potassium, and zinc on soil, corroborating the soil fertility hypothesis. The content of magnesium, potassium, iron and CTC (T) explained 72% of the variation in galling insect richness. Plant family size positively influenced galling insect richness, corroborating the plant family size hypothesis. Overall, the results corroborate the hypothesis that predicts that habitat stress is the main factor generating the patterns of galling insect richness in Brazilian savannas.

3510	WOS:000182653700001	Projected climate change effects on Rocky Mountain and Great Plains birds: generalities of biodiversity consequences	Global Change Biology	01/05/2003	NA	115	Climate change effects on biodiversity are already manifested, and yet no predictive knowledge characterizes the likely nature of these effects. Previous studies suggested an influence of topography on these effects, a possibility tested herein. Bird species with distributions restricted to montane (26 species) and Great Plains (19 species) regions of central and western North America were modeled, and climate change effects on their distributions compared: in general, plains species were more heavily influenced by climate change, with drastic area reductions (mode 35% of distributional area lost under assumption of no dispersal) and dramatic spatial movements (0-400 km shift of range centroid under assumption of no dispersal) of appropriate habitats. These results suggest an important generality regarding climate change effects on biodiversity, and provide useful guidelines for conservation planning.

Summing up the accumulated knowledge on biodiversity of these water bodies, the authors have noted the presence of 290 species of eukaryotic organisms, including 190 unicellular ones, and nearly 200 species of bacteria and archaea, of which at least 100 species are represented by cyanobacteria. It has been concluded that the diversity of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is still understudied. This paper is not an exhaustive review of the history of research on the biodiversity of Crimean hypersaline waters; it is rather a prelude to such a historical study, as well as a call for a broadening and deepening of the scientific knowledge of the unique biodiversity in these extreme habitats.

Because resources for conservation are limited, setting conservation priorities to use those resources effectively is crucial. To do so in a way that addresses people's most pressing concerns about biodiversity loss, managers and policy makers must understand those concerns. This study investigates preferences for an array of benefits associated with biodiversity and wildlife and the relative importance to people of each. A survey was administered to a sample of the US population to explore public preferences for types of benefits often associated with biodiversity., utilitarian (commodity and recreation), ecological (certain and uncertain), aesthetic, symbolic, and humanistic. Respondents were asked to rank hypothetical species presented in choice sets of three species, each described simply in terms of one type of benefit. A rank-ordered multinomial logit model was estimated to establish a ranking of the benefits and evaluate the sensitivity of the ranking to socio-demographic variables. The means of the sample predictions indicated the relative importance of each type of benefit. Confidence intervals were constructed to evaluate the extent to which the ranks could be distinguished from one another. Ecological functions were most important to survey respondents; commodity-based benefits and human attributes were of moderate importance; and recreation, aesthetics, and symbolic references in literature and art appeared to be least important.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness-biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness-biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness-biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness-biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness-biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.

Lessons from the uptake of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation by botanic gardens	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2012	10.1007/s10531-011-0174-1	17	International agreements and policies play an increasingly prominent role in strategies to combat biodiversity loss. However, conservation policies can only have a conservation impact if implemented. Identifying factors determining the influence of a policy on institutions could improve the process of policy development and communication. We examine how and why botanic gardens have responded to the first phase of a global conservation policy (the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation GSPC) using quantitative (questionnaires completed by 255 botanic gardens in 67 countries) and qualitative (in-depth interviews with five gardens in five countries) methods. We found that while the majority of gardens were aware of the GSPC, older gardens in the global north, and younger global south gardens are most influenced by the GSPC. Gardens that are members of a global botanic garden network and gardens with larger budgets are implementing more targets. Targets implemented tend to be aligned with existing institutional aims. Gardens highlighted an absence of a mechanism to feedback successes and failures. The GSPC has recently been reviewed and new targets for the period of 2011-2020 developed. To widen the influence of the GSPC, dissemination should include guidelines on how institutions could implement the policy, with particular focus on influencing younger global north gardens and older global south gardens. There are plans to develop a toolkit to help gardens better understand and implement the GSPC. We recommend the toolkit include a system for GSPC implementers to communicate with each other and to feedback to policy formulators.	Williams, Sophie J. ; Jones, Julia P.

Badgley: Good news for endangered species act advocates, bad news for at-risk species	Ecology Law Quarterly	01/01/2003	NA	0	In Biodiversity Legal Foundation v. Badgley, the Ninth Circuit held that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cannot delay the initial finding to list a species as threatened or endangered beyond the mandatory deadline for making a final determination to list the species. The court held that under the Endangered Species Act, both decisions must be made within twelve months of receiving the listing petition. The court rejected the Service's arguments that funding constraints prevent timely final determinations. However, the decision failed to elucidate permissible reasons for delaying the initial finding for up to a year. It also failed to determine whether the agency's Listing Priority Guidance, which relegates new listing petitions to the bottom of the Service's priority list, is valid. Moreover, while the decision will clearly benefit species' advocates by reining in agency delay, it may actually harm at-risk species that lack petitioners vying for their listing.

To benefit society and the urban ecosystem, green infrastructure should be effectively managed. We investigated carabid diversity and assemblage structure as indicators of biodiversity in green infrastructures in a rapidly developing urban area to identify the habitat's values. In addition, we attempted to reveal the effect of environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure, soil, and disturbance) that strongly contribute to carabid diversity and assemblage structure. Of the collected organisms, 6,154 individuals representing 20 carabid species were identified in the green infrastructure. Those species with flight ability and that were found in dry habitats were widely distributed and dominated green infrastructures. Carabid assemblages changed significantly in response to management practices. These changes were both positive and negative, with the negative changes increasing the instability of the carabid assemblages through the destruction of their habitat. Other factors, such as the presence of original habitat, habitat age, and habitat succession, also had a considerable effect on carabid diversity. We revealed that management practices prevented habitat succession, and these interactive effects determined carabid diversity and structure in green infrastructures.

In artificial foam, 19 species were reported, and in incubated leaves, 12 species. The most abundant and common species in all the sampling methods were: Alatospora acuminata, Anguillospora longissima, Campylospora sp., Clavatospora tentacula, Flagellospora curvula, Heliscus submersus, Lunulospora cymbiformis and Triscelophorus monosporus.

Montane Mediterranean cities have been understudied in terms of biodiversity, although they are often embedded in biodiversity hotspots. It therefore remains an open question, to which extent they may harbor species of special conservation interest and if the latter can be incorporated in urban planning. In this context, we assessed the urban flora of urban habitats in Ioannina (NW Greece), a city located in a highly valued region in terms of biological conservation. In four study areas, 16 ha each, we recorded 379 spontaneous taxa of vascular plants and assessed their abundance by a semi-quantitative approach. The representation of alien plants is low, compared to other Mediterranean cities (2.1% archaeophytes, 9.0% neophytes). Furthermore, the low archaeophyte to neophyte ratios in all habitats and the very small absolute numbers of archaeophytes indicate an urban environment submitted to a low rate of alien introduction. Endemics and taxa included in Greek and international conservation lists comprise 7.1% of the total city flora and occur both in indiscriminately inhabit all eleven habitats studied of both seminatural and anthropogenic type, forming medium to large populations in at least one study area. Ioannina displays the highest proportion of endemic taxa (4.8%) among the Mediterranean cities surveyed to date. Our findings illustrate the potential refuge function of urban habitats within Mediterranean cities, which should be strengthened in the further urban development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

7912	WOS:000290022500014	Practical application of self-organizing maps to interrelate biodiversity and functional data in NGS-based metagenomics	Isme Journal	01/05/2011	10.1038/ismej.2010.180	36	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled the application of broad-scale sequencing in microbial biodiversity and metagenome studies. Biodiversity is usually targeted by classifying 16S ribosomal RNA genes, while metagenomic approaches target metabolic genes. However, both approaches remain isolated, as long as the taxonomic and functional information cannot be interrelated. Techniques like self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been applied to cluster metagenomes into taxon-specific bins in order to link biodiversity with functions, but have not been applied to broad-scale NGS-based metagenomics yet. Here, we provide a novel implementation, demonstrate its potential and practicability, and provide a web-based service for public usage. Evaluation with published data sets mimicking varyingly complex habitats resulted into classification specificities and sensitivities of close to 100% to above 90% from phylum to genus level for assemblies exceeding 8 kb for low and medium complexity data. When applied to five real-world metagenomes of medium complexity from direct pyrosequencing of marine subsurface waters, classifications of assemblies above 2.5 kb were in good agreement with fluorescence in situ hybridizations, indicating that biodiversity was mostly retained within the metagenomes, and confirming high classification specificities. This was validated by two protein-based classifications (PBCs) methods. SOMs were able to retrieve the relevant taxa down to the genus level, while surpassing PBCs in resolution. In order to make the approach accessible to a broad audience, we implemented a feature-rich web-based SOM application named TaxSOM, which is freely available at http://www.megx.net/toolbox/taxsom. TaxSOM can classify reads or assemblies exceeding 2.5 kb with high accuracy and thus assists in linking biodiversity and functions in metagenome studies, which is a precondition to study microbial ecology in a holistic fashion.

The dataset is derived from more than 100 publications and includes over 600 species whose ranges can be used in diversity analysis. Stratigraphically well-constrained data from the Rapla and Mannamaa boreholes, northern Estonia, are analysed separately in order to provide additional information on the Middle to Late Ordovician microphytoplankton evolution on shallow shelf settings. The total species diversity and normalised diversity curves based on range-through data show a slight decrease from the Tremadocian to Floian, which may partly be attributed to limited data available. A continuous increase in diversity from the base of the Dapingian to late Darriwilian - early Katian can be observed, with highest total diversity approaching 250 species in the Keila Regional Stage. The highest appearance rates are recorded in the Dapingian and Darriwilian. Diversity progressively diminished after the early Katian with a more pronounced decrease in the upper Ordovician Porkuni Regional Stage, corresponding to the Hirnantian. A significant faunal turnover took place in the uppermost Ordovician Pirgu and Porkuni stages, with high extinction rates as well as the appearance of many acritarch taxa that are typical of the Silurian floras. The phytoplankton diversity curves match rather well with those of several other fossil groups in Baltica, notably brachiopods and ostracods. Comparison with other palynomorphs reveals both similarities and differences. The chitinozoans show the highest diversities in the upper Darriwilian, but their later decline predates that of acritarchs. A rapid diversification of scolecodonts (jawed polychaetes) can also be observed in the upper Darriwilian. However, unlike acritarchs or chitinozoans, their diversity continues to increase until the uppermost Katian. The acritarch diversity changes are analysed and discussed in the context of palaeogeographic (northwards drifting of Baltica) and palaeoclimatologic changes (rising sea levels up to the middle part of the Upper Ordovician). The increasing diversity of the phytoplankton not only roughly correlates with the Baltic and global sea-level changes, but also with the diversification of marine invertebrate groups.

As previously demonstrated, the 12th century BCE Philistine migration-to the southern Levantine littoral, involved the transportation of pigs from Europe, engendering long term genetic displacement of local Near Eastern haplotypes. Building on this, and combining biogeographical methods of Floral List comparisons with archaeological data, we have elucidated the Philistine impact on Southern Levantine floral ecosystems. We demonstrate that previously unexploited local plants were incorporated into the Philistine milieu, and new species were introduced-from Europe, the Aegean, Egypt and Mesopotamia - resulting in the earliest locally cultivated sycamore, cumin, coriander, bay tree and opium poppy. This research has highlighted the impact of past cultures on the formation of floral ecosystems and their long-term effects on contemporary local biological diversity.

The production capability of mycotoxin from fungal isolates was also examined. The mean fungal count in 21 different water and biofilm samples was determined as 234 CFU/100 mL and 4 CFU/cm(2). A total of 32 species were identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. The most common isolated fungi belonged to the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, of which the most prevalent fungi were Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium dipodomyicola. From 42% of the surveyed CTs, aflatoxigenic A. flavus isolates were identified. The detection of opportunistic pathogens and/or allergen species suggests that open recirculating CTs are a possible source of fungal infection for both the public and for occupational workers via the inhalation of aerosols and/or skin contact.

In this study, we examined the phytoplankton diversity, community structure, and possible determining factors in separate uranium mining-impacted waters. Some of these human-induced extreme environments may be able to sustain indigenous facultative extremophile phytoplankton species, as well as alleged obligate extremophiles. Therefore, we investigated the adaptation capacity of three laboratory strains, two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and a Dictyosphaerium chlorelloides, to uranium-polluted waters. The biodiversity among the sampled waters was very low, and despite presenting unique taxonomic records, ecological patterns can be identified. The microalgae adaptation experiments indicated a gradient of ecological novelty and different phenomena of adaptation, from acclimation in some waters to non-adaptation in the harshest anthropogenic environment. Certainly, phytoplankton extremophiles might have been often overlooked, and the ability to flourish in extreme environments might be a functional feature in some neutrophilic species. Evolutionary biology and microbial biodiversity can benefit the study of recently evolved systems such as uranium-polluted waters. Moreover, anthropogenic extremophiles can be harnessed for industrial applications.

These events led to the development of the Coastal Landscape Assessment and Modeling Study (CLAMS) for the Coast Range Physiographic Province of Oregon, a province containing over two million hectares of forest with a complex mixture of public and private ownership. Over a decade, CLAMS scientists developed regional data bases and tools to enable assessments of the implications of current policies for biodiversity and have begun using these data and tools to test ideas for solving policy problems. We summarize here four main lessons from our work: (1) Regional ecosystem perspectives, while rewarding, are difficult to achieve. Helping policy makers and the public understand biodiversity policies for an entire province can assist in developing more reasoned policies. However, this result is difficult to achieve because needed scientific building blocks generally do not exist, few policy institutions address regional cross-ownership issues, people can find it difficult to take a regional view, and the appropriate region for analysis changes with the policy problem. (2) Interest in environmental policy analysis may come as much from a pursuit of power as a pursuit of understanding. Biodiversity policy analyses are often viewed as weapons in an ongoing political battle. Also, results that might destabilize existing policies generally will not be well received by those in power. (3) The relationship of regional analyses to civic processes remains challenging and unsettled. Communication between citizens and scientists takes real effort. Also, collaborative processes both inspire and constrain regional policy analysis, and scientific work often proceeds at a different pace than these processes. In the end, CLAMS's most important effect on the civic dialogue may be to change how people think about the Coast Range. (4) An important role exists for anticipatory assessments done independently by scientists. Independent review will be especially important as policy analyses shift to management of nonfederal forests. Our future efforts in CLAMS will focus on evaluating ideas for fundamental changes in forest management.	Johnson, K.

(ICES J Mar Sci 64:1735-1742, 2007) reported that areas in the Wadden Sea selected by mechanical cockle dredgers were of greater zoobenthic diversity than areas that remained undredged. The present paper attempts to explain this observation, focussing on the elevation-related zoning of the macrobenthic fauna on tidal flats. Dense beds of cockles Cerastoderma edule occur in a specific intermediate intertidal-height zone where more species are present (and reach their maximal abundance) than in either lower or higher zones. This coincidence of preferred intertidal zones in many species, including cockles, may cause the higher species richness (and higher total macrozoobenthic biomass) of the fisher-chosen dredging areas as compared to other nearby non-dredged tidal-flat areas.

Despite the global recognition of its importance, the selection of protected areas has been ad hoc and the effectiveness of such choices has rarely been assessed. We compiled the most comprehensive distributional data set of Iberian terrestrial plant and vertebrate species available to date and used it to assess the degree of species representation within existing protected areas. Existing protected areas in Spain and Portugal reasonably represented the plant and animal species we considered (73-98%). Nevertheless, species of some groups (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and gymnosperms) did not accumulate in protected areas at a rate higher than expected by chance (p > 0.05). We determined that to conserve all vertebrate and plant species in the Iberian Peninsula, at least 36 additional areas are needed. Selection of additional areas for conservation would be facilitated if such areas coincided with sites of community importance (SCI) designated under the European Commission Habitats Directive. Additional areas required for full representation of the selected plant and animal species all coincide with SCI in Spain. Nevertheless, the degree of coincidence varies between 0.3% and 74.6%, and there is a possibility that important areas for conservation occur outside the SCI. Our results support the view that current SCI can be used for prioritization of areas for conservation, but a systematic reevaluation of conservation priorities in Spain and Portugal would be necessary to ensure that effective conservation of one of European's most important biodiversity regions is achieved.

Biological Conservation	05/01/2017	10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.012	20	Conservation biologists should seek to work with those involved in sustainable agriculture and rural development in expanded integrated approaches to,reduce pesticide harm to humans, biodiversity and environmental services. Despite new evidence, conservation organisations have tended not to fully recognize the impacts of pesticides on biodiversity, and current conservation strategies pay little heed to addressing this threat. A comprehensive suite of strategies are required to reduce and rationalize pesticide use and mitigate risks to species conservation. This paper proposes six steps for conservationists to address pesticide problems: (1) revisit the land sparing versus land sharing debate and include the external impacts of agriculture as vital components in systematic conservation planning; (2) redefine narratives on intensive agriculture and support emerging forms of sustainable intensification; (3) focus and inform on improved delivery mechanisms and monitoring legal use to achieve better pesticide targeting and a major reduction in volumes used; (4) support efforts to reduce wastage and inefficiency in the food system by promoting technical changes and informed consumer choice; (5) design and encourage resilient temperate and tropical landscapes that minimise pesticide contamination on farms and at landscape scale; and (6) develop comprehensive policy responses to promote both better alternatives to synthetic pesticides and limit the use of the most harmful pesticides.

The richness of the ichtyofauna is higher than in anyone of the Parisian Oligocene deposits and equals the one of the 'Argiles de Boom' (Belgian Rupelian). Its affinities with the septentrional ichtyofauna is confirmed, meridional elements being rare. The terrestrial fauna, the oldest known from stratotypical Stampian (base of the Upper Stampian) shares affinities with the one of Montalban and attests the occurrence of nearly freshwater environments.

Environmental & Resource Economics	06/01/2009	10.1007/s10640-008-9226-8	110	This paper is concerned with the empirical relationship between biodiversity conservation values and income. We use random effects panel models to examine the effects of income, and then GDP per capita, on willingness to pay for habitat and biodiversity conservation. In a meta-analysis, 145 Willingness To Pay estimates for biodiversity conservation where existence value plays a major role were collected from 46 contingent valuation studies across six continents. Other effects included in the meta-analysis were the study year; habitat type; continent; scope as presented to respondents; whether WTP bids were for preventing a deterioration or gaining an improvement in conservation, whether a specific species or specific habitat was protected; whether the questionnaire used a dichotomous choice or an open-ended format; distribution format; and the choice of payment vehicle. GDP per capita seemed to perform as well as an explanatory variable as respondent's mean stated income, indicating that it is wealth in society as a whole which determines variations in WTP. Even if large variation, our main conclusion is, that the demand for biodiversity conservation rises with a nation's wealth, but the income elasticity of willingness to pay is less than one.

These reserves were established for a variety of reasons-often unrelated to the protection of biodiversity. In 2000 in response to a growing concern about the lack of organized conservation reserve planning to protect the important threatened biological and physical features of Mexico, the Mexican Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) proposed the establishment of 151 new reserves for Mexico covering 5 1 429,500 ha. We compiled a GIS analysis using digital thematic maps of physical and biological features to examine how the existing and proposed reserves serve to protect the biodiversity and physical features of the country. Using a conservation target of placing a minimum of 12% of the land area of each important biophysical feature in nature reserves, we found that the 144 existing nature reserves covering 18 million ha (9% of the country) only meet that target for elevation ranges > 3000 m and areas with poor soils. These mountainous areas represent less than 12% of the country. The gaps in the existing nature reserves network occur mainly at lower and intermediate elevations ( < 3000 m) areas with xeric, tropical, and temperate ecosystems, and high productivity soils. The areas proposed by CONABIO increase the proportion of protected lands in the country to over 27% and most of the conservation targets for geophysical features, and land cover, categories are met. Whether this area would be sufficient to maintain viable populations and ecological integrity of species and ecosystems is unknown. Even with the new reserves, low elevation coastal lands would be below the conservation target in the nature reserves. To include a representative sample of these lands would be difficult as these are the same areas where the majority of people live. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

4796	WOS:000247203100011	Present forest biodiversity patterns in France related to former Roman agriculture	Ecology	06/01/2007	NA	126	Combined archaeological and ecological investigations in a large ancient oak forest in Central France have revealed a dense network of ancient human settlements dating from the Roman period. We demonstrate a strong correlation between present-day forest plant diversity patterns and the location of Roman farm buildings. Plant species richness strongly increases toward the center of the settlements, and the frequency of neutrophilous and nitrogen-demanding species is higher. This pattern is paralleled by an increase in soil pH, available P, and delta N-15, indicating the long-term impact of former agricultural practices on forest biogeochemical cycles. These extensive observations in a forested region on acid soils complement and confirm previous results from a single Roman settlement on limestone. Ancient Roman agricultural systems are increasingly being identified in contemporary French forests; the broad extent and long-lasting effects of previous cultivation shown in this study require that land-use history be considered as a primary control over biodiversity variations in many forest landscapes, even after millennia of abandonment.

Transformative societal change is required in response. However, while the Global Observing System for Climate has coordinated climate observations for these assessments, there has been no equivalent actor for the biodiversity assessment. Here we argue that a central agency for coordinated biodiversity observations can lead to an improved assessment process for biodiversity status and coupled climate biodiversity observations in areas of mutual interest such as monitoring indicators of Natures Contributions to People. A global biodiversity observation system has already begun to evolve through bottom up development of the Essential Biodiversity Variables. We propose recommendations on how to build on this progress through definition of user requirements, observation principles, creation of a community data basis and regional actions through existing networks.

In this paper, we list spiders from French Guiana from existing literature (with corrected nomenclature when necessary) and from 2142 spiders sampled in 12 sites for this baseline study. Three hundred and sixty four validated species names of spider were found in the literature and previous authors' works. Additional sampling, conducted for this study added another 89 identified species and 62 other species with only a genus name for now. The total species of spiders sampled in French Guiana is currently 515. Many other Morphospecies were found but not described as species yet. An accumulation curve was drawn with seven of the sampling sites and shows no plateau yet. Therefore, the number of species inhabiting French Guiana cannot yet be determined. As the very large number of singletons found in the collected materials suggests, the accumulation curve indicates nevertheless that more sampling is necessary to discover the many unknown spider species living in French Guiana, with a focus on specific periods (dry season and wet season) and on specific and poorly studied habitats such as canopy, inselberg and cambrouze (local bamboo monospecific forest).

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear-a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reducewithin-sample species richness by anaverage of 76.5%, total abundance by 39.5% andrarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries.

We were able to compare the 1-year old baseline data from permanent plots with the altered species composition after the flood. First, we present a detailed analysis of the baseline biodiversity data as a comparison of the tree and understorey species composition between the late successional and the old forest. We compared the plot community quality aspect-the characteristics of species composition (% geophytes, Illyrian species, presence of vulnerable species, etc.) and the community structure according to biodiversity indicators (S, E, H'). To analyze changes in the understorey after the flood, we calculated species turnover through the Sorensen pairwise dissimilarity index (beta_sor) and investigated differences in species survival and post-flood occurrence changes. In our study, the flood did have an impact on understorey communities, and recovery was slower in the case of the species-poor understorey, with more new species entering the existing species composition, among them alien invasive species. Results suggest that high biodiversity in the under storey forms the basis for better disturbance resilience, with lower mortality and a higher nestedness component for recovery in such an understorey. Our results demonstrate how important it is to maintain high biodiversity in order to sustain the ecological resilience of even small and urban forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mineral soil samples from a grassland were fumigated with chloroform for up to 24 h and then incubated for 5 months to allow recolonisation by surviving organisms. The diversity of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria, protozoa and nematodes was progressively reduced by increasing fumigation times, as was the number of trophic groups, phyla within trophic groups, and taxa within phyla. Total microbial biomass was similar within fumigated soils, but lower than for unfumigated soil. There was no direct relationship between biodiversity and function. Some broad-scale functional parameters increased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. thymidine incorporation, growth on added nutrients, and the decomposition rate of plant residues. Other more specific parameters decreased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. nitrification, denitrification and methane oxidation. Thus specific Functional parameters may be a more sensitive indicator of environmental change than general parameters. Although fumigation reduced soil microbial biodiversity, there was evidence to suggest that it selected for organisms with particular physiological characteristics. The consequences of this for interpreting biodiversity - function relationships are discussed. The stability of the resulting communities to perturbation was further examined by imposing a transient (brief healing to 40 degrees C) or a persistent (addition of CuSO4) stress. Decomposition of grass residues was determined on three occasions after such perturbations. The soils clearly demonstrated resilience to the transient stress; decomposition rates were initially depressed by the stress and recovered over time. Resilience was reduced in the soils with decreasing biodiversity. Soils were not resilient to the persistent stress, there was no recovery in decomposition rate over time, but the soils with the highest biodiversity were more resistant to the stress than soils with impaired biodiversity. The study of functional stability under applied perturbation is a powerful means of examining the effects of biodiversity.

We quantified insect feeding on 3,599 leaves from the speciose Laguna del Hunco flora (Chubut, Argentina), which dates to the early Eocene climatic optimum (52 million years ago) and compared the results with three well preserved, rich, and identically analyzed early- and middle-Eocene floras from the following sites in North America: Republic, WA; Green River, LIT; and Sourdough, WY. We found significantly more damage diversity at Laguna del Hunco than in the North American floras, whether measured on bulk collections or on individual plant species, for both damage morphotypes and feeding groups. An ancient history of rich, specialized plant-insect associations on diverse plant lineages in warm climates may be a major factor contributing to the current biodiversity of South America.

Natural history museums hold specimens that represent the only information available for most species. Ecological niche models (sometimes termed species distributionmodels) combine such information with digital environmental data (especially climatic) to offer key insights for conservation biology, management of invasive species, zoonotic human diseases, and other pressing environmental problems. Five major pitfalls seriously hinder such research, especially for cross-space or cross-time uses: (1) incorrect taxonomic identifications; (2) lacking or inadequate databasing and georeferences; (3) effects of sampling bias across geography; (4) violation of assumptions related to selection of the study region; and (5) problems regarding model evaluation to identify optimal model complexity. Large-scale initiatives regarding data availability and quality, technological development, and capacity building should allow high-quality modeling on a scale commensurate with the enormous potential of and need for these techniques.

Most exotic tree plantations support lower levels of biodiversity and have less potential for ecosystem services supply than natural forests, and differencing them is still a challenge using standard tools. We use a novel approach in south-central of Chile to differentiate tree cover dynamics among natural forests and exotic tree plantations. Chile has one of the world's most competitive forestry industry and the region is a global biodiversity hotspot. Our collaborative visual interpretation method combined a global database of tree cover change, remote sensing from high-resolution satellite images and expert knowledge. By distinguishing exotic tree plantation and natural forest loss, we fit spatially explicit models to estimate tree-cover loss across 40 millions of ha between 2000 and 2016. We were able to distinguish natural forests from exotic tree plantations with an overall accuracy of 99% and predicted forest loss. Total tree cover loss was continuous over time, and the disaggregation revealed that 1 549 909 ha of tree plantations were lost (mean = 96 869 ha year(-1)), while 206 142 ha corresponded to natural forest loss (mean = 12 884 ha year(-1)). Mostly of tree plantations lost returned to be plantation (51%). Natural forests were converted mainly (75%) to transitional land covers (e.g. shrubland, bare land, grassland), and an important proportion of these may finish as tree plantation. This replacement may undermine objectives of increasedcarbon storage and biodiversity. Tree planting as a solution has gained increased attention in recen years with ambitious commitments to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, negative outcomes for the environment could result if strategies incentivize the replacement of natural forests into other land covers. Initiatives to reduce carbon emissions should encourage differentiating natural forests from exotic tree plantations and pay more attention on protecting and managing sustainably the former.

This paper presents the results of ethnobotanical research undertaken in the community of Basihuare in the Sierra Tarahuniara, to provide details on some practical aspects of the Raramuri worldview regarding interconnections between people and their environment. This traditional philosophy forms the basis for the use of edible wild plants and the harvesting strategies practiced in Basihuare, such as selective harvesting, environmental modification and domestication. These activities provide the opportunity for harvesters to monitor the landscape and the plant resources that occur on the land, as well as present a setting for the communication and exchange of traditional ecological knowledge. However, Raramuri harvesting practices are tinder stress because of increased external pressures from commercial timber extraction and other development. We discuss the state of traditional ecological knowledge and its transmission in the context of development activities in the region. The key to sustainability in the Sierra Tarahumara may be the maintenance of traditional management practices for edible wild plants, and other non-timber forest products, that lead to the conservation of biodiversity by creating patchiness and renewing the plant cover on the land.

However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and similar to 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which similar to 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.

493	WOS:000329431400008	Is there a link between deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem function?	Marine Ecology-an Evolutionary Perspective	01/09/2013	10.1111/maec.12019	12	Studying the diversity-ecosystem function relationship in the deep sea is of primary importance in the face of biodiversity loss and for our understanding of how the deep sea functions. Results from the first study of diversity-ecosystem function relationships in the deep sea (Danovaro etal. 2008; Current Biology, 18, 1-8) are unexpected and show an exponential relationship between deep-sea nematode diversity and ecosystem function and efficiency, although this relationship appears largely restricted to relatively low diversities [ES(51) <25]. Here, we investigate the relationship between nematode diversity and several independent measures/proxies of ecosystem function (sediment community oxygen consumption, bacterial biomass, bacterial extracellular enzyme activity) and efficiency (ratio of bacterial/nematode carbon to organic C content of the sediment) on the New Zealand continental slope. Nematode diversity at our study sites was relatively high [ES(51)=30-42], and there was no relationship between species/functional diversity and ecosystem function/efficiency after accounting for the effects of water depth and food availability. Our results are consistent with a breakdown of the exponential diversity-function relationship at high levels of diversity, which may be due to increased competition or greater functional redundancy. Future studies need to take into account as many environmental factors and as wide a range of diversities as possible to provide further insights into the diversity-ecosystem function relationship in the largest ecosystem on Earth.

A recent faunal inventory (BIOLAVE) was conducted on the underwater lava flows of Piton de La Fournaise and constitutes the first submarine survey on the south-east side of the island. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the species richness in the different echinoderm classes and assess their potential as indicator of the colonisation of lava with different ages. During 8 days, 9 sites with different habitats defined by depth and substrate homogeneity were explored using a stratified sampling. Description of echinoderms and comparison of the taxonomic composition between sites of different ages and depths were presented. 45 species of the 5 classes were identified, belonging to 23 families and 32 genera. Ophiuroid was the most diverse class (22 species), followed by echinoids (13 species), asteroids and holothuroids (6 species each), and crinoids (2 species). Species number increased with lava flow's age, except for echinoids, which showed a higher species number on recent sites, but ophiuroids only showed a significantly higher species number on the oldest sites. On the contrary, species number tended to decrease with depth, but echinoids only showed a significantly higher species number on shallow water. Some asteroid, echinoid and holothuroid species, such as Aquilonastra richmondi, Asthenosoma variurn, Echinothrix spp., Echinometra mathaei and Euapta godeffroyi, were observed on the most recent sites only, while some ophiuroid species were observed in deeper sites only. These characteristic species could be seen as bioindicators of disturbed environment or have a distribution restricted to deeper areas.

There is a need to project possible future land use and assess impacts on nature reserves as a guide to future management. We assessed the potential biodiversity impacts of alternative future land use scenarios in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. An existing regression-based simulation model was used to project three alternative scenarios of future rural home development. The spatial patterns of forecasted development were then compared to several biodiversity response variables that included cover types, species habitats, and biodiversity indices. We identified the four biodiversity responses most at risk of exurban development, designed growth management policies to protect these areas, and tested their effectiveness in two alternative future scenarios. We found that the measured biodiversity responses, including riparian habitat, elk winter range, migration corridors, and eight other land cover, habitat, and biodiversity indices, are likely to undergo substantial conversion (between 5% and 40%) to exurban development by 2020. Future habitat conversion to exurban development outside the region's nature reserves is likely to impact wildlife populations within the reserves.

Key questions remain, however, as to what extent plankton taxa within these lifeforms share responses to environmental change. Addressing this knowledge gap can provide additional information on the influence of environmental drivers, including climate change, on plankton communities. Here, we use a multi-decadal plankton time series to examine the extent to which taxa within lifeforms share responses to sea surface temperature (SST) change. At the North Sea scale, the individual taxa responses within the dinoflagellate lifeform are skewed towards a negative response to increasing SST, consolidating previous findings that dinoflagellate abundance is decreasing with ocean warming. The individual taxa responses within the zooplankton lifeforms, however, varied, suggesting that lifeform traits are less of a factor determining response to SST for zooplankton than for phytoplankton. The lifeform level of grouping taxa, therefore, is useful for communicating change in the state and functioning of ecosystems, but finer taxonomically resolved data are essential for determining the drivers of plankton community change, including climate influences, during formal assessments."

Weitzman's framework has been criticized as being unsuitable for the global problem of biodiversity loss. This paper responds to this critique. It is shown that Weitzman's framework of diversity measurement can be made practical and applicable by shifting the level analysis from species to ecosystems.

Measures to mitigate road mortality are costly so should be implemented using cost-effective measures in locations where the road mortality is consistently highest and non-random in different species. It is thus important to identify what features causes these biodiversity collision blackspots. Almost all of the data and literature on collisions refer to vertebrates with little known about invertebrates. We used data on butterfly roadkills in three large landscape plots in Poland to identify sites where the collision rate seems to be routinely high. Biodiversity collision blackspots were identified from occurrence in successive years using spatial hierarchical clustering. Biodiversity collision blackspots comprised just 4% of the total road length, but included 49% of all road-killed butterflies. Habitats within 500 m of each blackspot was compared to random non-blackspot sites using generalized linear mixed models. The occurrence of blackspots was linked with high traffic volume, but only when cover of grassland in a landscape was high and verges had low plant species richness. Similarly, blackspots occurred with high probability when traffic volume was high but especially if grassland cover in the landscape and verge mowing frequency were also high. These blackspots had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies in the surrounding landscape than in random sites. Biodiversity collision blackspots analysis identified road sections of high road mortality for different butterfly species. Moreover, blackspots were also indication of species rich areas of conservation concern that were intersected by roads. Thus, conservation practitioners may direct mitigation measures, such as less frequent mowing and speed limit, in a cost-efficient manner in these spatially-limited locations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The biodiversity of the three main feeding groups - predators, soil ingesters and litter consumers - was also significantly higher in the grass strips than in the field edges without strips, indicating that establishment of grassy margins in arable fields may enhance ecosystem services such as soil fertility and pest control. The grass strip habitat contained a large number of species of soil macrofauna, being second only to hedgerow habitat, with 10% of the total species list for the farm found only within the margins. Of the rare species recorded on the farm, five of the nine were from the grass strips, four of which were found only there. This study shows that establishing grassy strips in the margins of arable fields increases the biodiversity of the soil macrofauna, both within fields (alpha diversity) and across the farm (beta diversity).

We present a methodological approach for identification and mapping of important structural and environmental features of forest stands. Based on an analysis of habitats of red-listed species and a synthesis of results from research on spatial distribution of forest species, we developed a habitat inventory approach (Complementary Hotspot Inventory, CHI) that is currently used in forestry planning in Norway The CHI maps fine-scale hotspots for 12 habitat types that are further classified according to positions along main environmental gradients (productivity and humidity). Consisting of different substrates in different environments, these habitats to a large degree support different species assemblages. By incorporating both the hotspot and the complementary approach, the CHI produces data tuned for later conservation measures. The high spatial resolution of data facilitates the use of conservation measures at different spatial scales, from single-tree retention to forest reserves. A validation test of habitats identified by CHI showed that the density of red-listed species was four times that of randomly selected old forests. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During a survey of 18 wet Erica tetralix heathlands, we identified 624 species from 20 different taxonomic groups. Sites with the single indicator species M. alcon were significantly richer in typical wet heathland species and in Red List species but did not show significant differences in biotope quality (i.e., the number of different typical wet heathland biotope attributes) than sites without. In addition, we used a multispecies indicator approach including a group of nine species from five different taxonomic groups (two birds, two dragonflies, two butterflies, two vascular plants and one grasshopper). High quality sites (5-9 species from the multispecies indicator group present) tended to have more Red list species than low quality sites (0-4 species from the multispecies indicator group present) but did not expose differences in overall species richness, typical wet heathland species or in biotope quality. The number of species in this umbrella group, however, was positively correlated with both the diversity of typical wet heathland species and with biotope quality. Furthermore, the complementary information, of the species in the multispecies indicator group usefully signalled distinctions in biotope area and configuration, vulnerability to fragmentation, eutrophication, desiccation and contained species of different trophic levels; this was not the case for M. alcon as a single indicator species. We discuss the use of a single indicator and of a multispecies group as conservation umbrella and advocate a much wider use of combined knowledge from different taxonomic groups in conservation planning and evaluation.

We found that the risk of additional species extinction, following the loss of one species in model food webs, decreases with the number of species per functional group. For a given number of species per functional group, the risk of further extinctions is highest when an autotroph is removed and lowest when a top predator is removed. In addition, stability decreases when the distribution of interaction strengths in the webs is changed from equal to skew (few strong and many weak links). We also found that omnivory appears to stabilize model food webs. Our results indicate that high biodiversity may serve as an insurance against radical ecosystem changes.

Here, we show a pronounced latitudinal increase in phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic biodiversity in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades. We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.

From Assessing to Conserving Biodiversity: Conceptual and Practical Challenges	01/01/2019	10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2_18	2	This paper argues that biodiversity should be understood as a normative concept constrained by a set of adequacy conditions that reflect scientific explications of diversity. That there is a normative aspect to biodiversity has long been recognized by environmental philosophers though there is no consensus on the question of what, precisely, biodiversity is supposed to be. There is also disagreement amongst these philosophers as well as amongst conservationists about whether the operative norms should view biodiversity as a global heritage or as embodying local values. After critically analyzing and rejecting the first alternative, this paper gives precedence to local values in defining biodiversity but then notes many problems associated with this move. The adequacy conditions to constrain all natural features from being dubbed as biodiversity include a restriction to biotic elements, attention to variability, and to taxonomic spread, as well as measurability. The biotic elements could be taxa, community types, or even non-standard land cover units such as sacred groves. This approach to biodiversity is intended to explicate its use within the conservation sciences which is the context in which the concept (and term) was first introduced in the late 1980s. It differs from approaches that also attempt to capture the co-option of the term in other fields such as systematics.

Known primarily from environmental DNA sequences, the group contains few formally described and successfully cultured genera, all known as obligate endoparasites. Numerous studies have detected Cryptomycota as DNA sequences in aquatic, terrestrial, and animal associated habitats, though no study to date has specifically targeted the group by PCR. In this study, we developed Cryptomycota-specific and preferential primers for the 185 rRNA gene in order to facilitate studies on the biodiversity and ecology of the group. The diversity of sequences and habitat association of Cryptomycota was surveyed across three environments: freshwater sediment, marine sediment, and soil. The new primers were able to recover a large proportion of Cryptomycota sequences: of 56 sequences cloned or directly sequenced, 44 were unique OTUs and (39/44) 88.6 % were phylogenetically affiliated with Cryptomycota. This study expands the boundary of current Cryptomycota sequence diversity; unique Cryptomycota OTUs were spread across six of 12 supported Cryptomycota sub dades. Freshwater sediments and soil were consistently amplified with the Cryptomycota-preferential primers. Our results suggest that Cryptomycota are ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse components of essentially all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whose ecological functions should be better explored.

Urbanization can follow two extreme types of development within a continuum: land sharing (buildings mixed with dispersed green space) or land sparing (buildings interspersed with green patches that concentrate biodiversity-supporting vegetation). Recent local-scale studies indicate that biodiversity is typically favored by land sparing. We investigated which of these two types of urbanization is associated with a higher taxonomic (i.e. species richness), functional, and phylogenetic diversity of birds. To do so, we collected information on breeding and wintering bird assemblages in 45 land-sharing and 45 land-sparing areas in nine European cities, which provide the first attempt to explore this question using a large geographical scale and temporal replication. We found that land-sharing urban areas were significantly associated with a higher taxonomic and functional diversity of birds during winter, but not during the breeding season (with only a marginally significant effect for functional diversity). We found no association between the type of urban development and phylogenetic diversity. Our findings indicate that not all components of avian diversity are similarly affected by these two means of urban planning and highlight the importance of integrating the temporal perspective into this kind of studies. Our results also offer useful information to the current debate about the trade-off between biodiversity conservation and human well-being in the context of land sharing and sparing urban practices. In addition, we found that certain small-scale urban landscape characteristics (i.e. few impervious surfaces, high water or tree cover) and human practices (i.e. bird feeders or plants with berries) can help maintaining more diverse urban bird assemblages. We provide specific suggestions for both policymakers and citizens that hopefully will help to create more biodiversity-friendly cities in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using a choice experiment, WTP was estimated for the protection of the following attributes: animals (mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds), pollinating insects, plants (cacti and woody shrubs), soil quality and pristine landscapes. Visitors placed economic value on all of the attributes. The marginal mean WTP/visitor for the single levels of variation in the attributes ranged from US$4 (for supporting research on foxes) to US$26 (for maintaining soil quality) per visitor per month. These results can contribute to deciding which attributes are likely to be successful at raising funds for conservation. Our approach may be relevant to protected areas of the world with high conservation values, little funding and a lack of large, charismatic species.

Over the last few decades, poverty, population pressure, environmental degradation, and political conflict have intensified in Chiapas. Widespread political unrest and violence continue despite a ""cease-fire"" between the Mexican government and supporters of the Zapatista movement that first appeared in 1994. Despite these odds, projects aiming to support traditional indigeneous health care while exploring ways of conserving local biodiversity are being continued in Highland Chiapas."

We analysed delta S between pre-1980 and post-1980 periods using 5 grid resolutions (10x10, 20x20, 40x40, 80x80 and 160x160 km). We also tested the effect of data quality and of unequal survey periods on delta S estimates, and checked for spatial autocorrelation of delta S estimates. Using data from equal survey periods, we found significant increases in hoverfly species richness in the Netherlands at fine scales, but no significant change at coarser scales indicating a decrease in beta diversity. In the UK, delta S was negative at fine scale, near zero at intermediate scales, and positive at coarse scales, indicating that the degree of spatial beta diversity increased between the time periods. The use of unequal survey periods (using longer periods in the past to compensate for lower survey intensity) tended to inflate past species richness, biasing delta S estimates downwards. High data quality thresholds sometimes obscured dynamics by reducing sample size, but never reversed trends. There was little spatial autocorrelation of delta S, implying that local drivers (land use change or environmental noise) are important in dynamics of hoverfly diversity. A second, sample agglomeration approach to measure scaling resulted in greater noise in delta S, obscuring the NL pattern, while still showing strong evidence of fine-scale richness loss in the UK. Our results indicate that explicit considerations of spatial (and temporal) scale are essential in studies documenting past biodiversity change, or projecting change into the future.

Researchers have tried to understand this relationship by focusing either on how diversity is influenced by the availability of resources, or alternatively, how resource abundance is influenced by species diversity. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox '... is species diversity the cause or the consequence of resources that limit community biomass?' Here we present results of an experiment that show it is possible for species diversity and resource density to exhibit reciprocal causal relationships in the same ecological system. Using a guild of ladybeetle predators and their aphid prey, we manipulated the number of predator species in field enclosures to examine how predator diversity impacts prey population size. At the same time, we manipulated the abundance of aphid prey in discrete habitat patches within each enclosure to determine how smaller-scale spatial variation in resource abundance affects the number of co-occurring predator species. We found that the number of ladybeetle species added to enclosures had a significant impact on aphid population dynamics because interference competition among the predators reduced per capita rates of predation and, in turn, the overall efficiency of the predator guild. At the same time, spatial variation in aphid abundance among smaller habitat patches generated variation in the observed richness of ladybeetles because more species occurred in patches where predators aggregated in response to high aphid density. The results of our experiment demonstrate that it is possible for species diversity to simultaneously be a cause and a consequence of resource density in the same ecological system, and they shed light on how this might occur for groups of mobile consumers that exhibit rapid responses to spatial and temporal variation in their prey.

Here we examine a one-trophic level system with generalized species interactions, including species-specific intraspecific and interspecific interaction strengths, and density-independent immigration from a regional species pool. Comparisons between results from numerical integrations and an approximate analytic calculation for random communities demonstrate good agreement, and both approaches yield abundance distributions of nearly arbitrary shape, including bimodality for intermediate immigration rates.

Their ecological importance can be assessed through plant biodiversity and such ecosystem functions as primary productivity and nitrate removal capacity. Multivariate analysis were used to establish a hierarchy of environmental factors related to he vegetation structure and diversity. Four different measures of plant diversity (both structural and functional) were made on a Seine River wetland. Key functions of estuarine floodplain (productivity and denitrification capacity) were either measured directly or assessed using remotely sensed data. The richest plant communities correspond to mesophilous grasslands which have an intermediate position between natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes. These species assemblages occur in ecosystems presenting both a regular productivity in time and space and the highest denitrification potentiality.

Still, much uncertainty exists about how individual and population-level traits of these species contribute to ecosystem processes and how engineering species jointly affect biodiversity. In this manipulative field experiment, we examined how biodiversity in marginal blue mussel beds is affected by blue mussel (1) body size, density and patch context and (2) presence of fucoid and algal structures. In the study area, bladder-wrack (Fucus vesiculosus), filamentous algae and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) coexist at shallow depths in a variety of patch configurations and offer complex habitats with a high variability of resources. We hypothesized that complexity in terms of mussel bed structure and algal presence determines species composition and abundance. Results from the experiment were compared with macrofaunal communities found in natural populations of both engineering species. Results show that the physical structure and blue mussel patch context are important determinants for species composition and abundance. Results further show that the presence of algal structures positively affects diversity in blue mussel habitats due to increased surface availability and complexity that these algae offer. This study shows that blue mussel beds at the very margin of their distribution have an indisputable function for promoting and maintaining biodiversity and suggest that facilitative effects of habitat-modifying species are important on Baltic Sea rocky shores with fundamental importance to community structure.

1390	WOS:000167876900008	Selecting herb-rich forest networks to protect different measures of biodiversity	Ecological Applications	04/01/2001	NA	11	Data on vascular plants of herb-rich forests in Finland were used to compare the efficiency of reserve selection methods in representing three measures of biodiversity: species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and restricted-range diversity. Comparisons of reserve selection methods were carried out both with and without consideration of the existing reserve system. Our results showed that the success of a reserve network of forests in representing different measures of biodiversity depends on the selection procedure, selection criteria, and data set used. Ad hoc selection was the worst option. A scoring procedure was generally more efficient than maximum random selection. Heuristic methods also appeared to be efficient. Each biodiversity measure can be used as a criterion for a selection algorithm and as a measure of efficiency of protection at the network level. The results indicate that different measures of biodiversity should be taken into account. For instance, phylogenetic diversity of a network was maximized by a heuristic method using phylogenetic diversity as the selection criterion. However, a heuristic method based on restricted-range diversity was more efficient than that based on species richness in representing high species richness in a forest network. Our results showed also that complementing the existing reserves is less efficient than selection starting with a blank slate. That is, the total number of sites required to protect a given level of biodiversity is higher when complementing the existing network, because some previously protected sites contribute relatively little diversity to the network. Data on species of a historic network should be available when new sites are selected for complementing the historic network.

Despite their increasing use, little quantitative data are available on what species and habitats conservation easements aim to protect, how much structural development they allow, or what types of land use they commonly permit. Too address these knowledge gaps, we surveyed staff responsible for 119 conservation easements established by the largest nonprofit easement holder, The Nature Conservancy, between 1985 and 2004. Most easements (80%) aimed to provide core habitat to protect species or communities on-site, and nearly all were designed to reduce development. Conservation easements also allowed for a wide range of private uses, which may result in additional fragmentation and habitat disturbance. Some residential or commercial use, new structures, or subdivision of the property were permitted on 85% of sampled conservation easements. Over half (56%) allowed some additional buildings, of which 60% restricted structure size or building area. Working landscape easements with ranching, forestry, or farming made up nearly half (46%) of the easement properties sampled and were more likely than easements without these uses to be designated as buffers to enhance biodiversity in the surrounding area. Our results demonstrate the need for clear restrictions on building and subdivision in easements, research on the compatibility of private uses on easement land, and greater public understanding of the trade-offs implicit in the use of conservation easements for biodiversity conservation.

We reviewed 85 biodiversity conservation projects supported by the Spanish Ministry of Environment's Biodiversity Foundation. Through content analysis and descriptive statistics, we examined how the projects carried out communication, education, and public awareness and participation (CEPA) actions. We also used multivariate statistical analysis to develop a typology of 4 classes of biodiversity conservation projects on the basis of CEPA implementation. The classifications were delineated by purpose of CEPA, level of integration of CEPA actions, type of CEPA goals, main CEPA stakeholders, and aim of conservation. Our results confirm the existence of 2 key positions: CEPA has intrinsic value (i.e., they supposed the implementation of any CEPA action indirectly supported conservation) and CEPA is an instrument for achieving conservation goals. We also found that most CEPA actions addressed general audiences and school children, ignored minority groups and women, and did not include evaluation. The characteristics of the 4 types of projects and their frequency of implementation in the sample reflect the need for better integration of different types of actions (communication, education, and participation) and improved fostering of participation of multiple stakeholders in developing policy and implementing management strategies. Tipologia de la Divulgacion Publica para Proyectos de Conservacion de la Biodiversidad en Espana Resumen Los programas de educacion y divulgacion para la conservacion son un acercamiento clave para promover el entendimiento publico de la importancia de la conservacion de la biodiversidad. Revisamos 85 proyectos de conservacion ejecutados con el apoyo de la Fundacion Biodiversidad del Ministerio de Medio Ambiente Espanol. Por medio del analisis de contenido y estadistica descriptiva examinamos como los proyectos llevan a cabo acciones de comunicacion, educacion, conciencia publica y participacion (CEPA). Tambien usamos analisis estadisticos multivariados para desarrollar una tipologia de cuatro tipos de proyectos de conservacion con base en la implementacion de CEPA. Las clasificaciones fueron delineadas a partir del proposito de CEPA, el nivel de integracion de acciones de CEPA, el tipo de objetivos de CEPA, principales destinatarios/as de CEPA y los objetivos de conservacion. Nuestros resultados confirman la existencia de dos posiciones clave: CEPA con valor intrinseco (la cual presupone que la implementacion de cualquier accion CEPA apoya indirectamente la conservacion) y CEPA como instrumento para la consecucion de objetivos de conservacion. Tambien descubrimos que la mayoria de acciones CEPA se dirigen al publico en general y escolares, ignoran a grupos minoritarios y mujeres, y no incluyen una evaluacion. Las caracteristicas de los cuatro tipos de proyectos y su frecuencia de implementacion en la muestra reflejan la necesidad de una mejor integracion de los diferentes tipos de acciones (comunicacion, educacion y participacion) y de una mejora en el fomento de la participacion de multiples destinatarios/as en el desarrollo de politicas y la implementacion de estrategias de gestion.

The Biodiversity Conservation Network brought together conservation and development organizations and local communities to systematically test this hypothesis across 39 conservation project sites in Asia and the Pac ftc. Each project implemented one or more community-based enterprises such as setting up an ecotourism lodge, distilling essential oils from wild plant roots, producing jams and jellies from forest fruits, harvesting timber, or collecting marine samples to test for pharmaceutical compounds. Each project team collected the biological, enterprise, and social data necessary to test the network's hypothesis. We present the results of this test. We found that a community-based enterprise strategy can lead to conservation, but only under limited conditions and never on its own. We summarize the specific conditions under which an enterprise strategy will and will not work in a decision chart that can be used by project managers to determine whether this strategy might make sense at their site. We also found that an enterprise strategy can be subsidized and still create a net gain that pays for conservation. Based on our experiences, we recommend developing ""learning portfolios"" that combine action and research to test other conservation strategies."

When the dispersal rate of soil animals was taken into account, quite opposite trends were displayed by species having poor or high dispersal capabilities. At the local level, species with short legs, non functional jumping apparatus and reduction of visual organs were distinguished against by landuse diversity, while species with long legs, functional jumping apparatus (furcula) and complete eyes, thus able to disperse at the soil surface, were not. It was verified, through aerial photographs taken 50 years ago, that landuse changes, expected to be more frequent in heterogeneous landscapes, may contribute to explain this phenomenon.

To maximize the return on investment in freshwater conservation with limited financial resources, managers must prioritize management actions that are most cost-effective. However, little is known about what these priorities may be under the combined effects of climate and land-cover change. We present a novel decision-making framework for prioritizing conservation resources to different management actions for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. The approach is novel in that it has the ability to model interactions, rank management options for dealing with conservation threats from climate and land-cover change, and integrate empirical data with expert knowledge. We illustrate the approach using a case study in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia under climate change, land-cover change and their combined effects. Our results show that the explicit inclusion of multiple threats and costs results in quite different priorities than when costs and interactions are ignored. When costs are not considered, stream and riparian restoration, as a single management strategy, provides the greatest overall protection of macroinvertebrate and fish richness in rural and urban areas of SEQ in response to climate change and/or urban growth. Whereas, when costs are considered, farm/land management with stream and riparian restoration are the most cost-effective strategies for macroinvertebrate and fish conservation. Our findings support riparian restoration as the most effective adaptation strategy to climate change and urban development, but because it is expensive it may often not be the most cost-efficient strategy. Our approach allows for these decisions to be evaluated explicitly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To investigate how coevolutionary interactions are shaped within species-rich communities, we characterized the architecture of an array of quantitative, mutualistic networks spanning a broad geographic range. These coevolutionary networks are highly asymmetric, so that if a plant species depends strongly on an animal species, the animal depends weakly on the plant. By using a simple dynamical model, we showed that asymmetries inherent in coevolutionary networks may enhance long-term coexistence and facilitate biodiversity maintenance.

For Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes, however, centres of high species richness and centres of high endemicity are not concordant. Moreover ranges are not, on average, smaller inside the Central Indo-Pacific (CI-P) biodiversity hotspot. The disparity between richness and endemicity arises because corals and reef fishes have strongly skewed range distributions, with many species being very widespread. Consequently, the largest ranges overlap to generate peaks in species richness near the equator and the CI-P biodiversity hotspot, with only minor contributions from endemics. Furthermore, we find no relationship between the number of coral vs. fish endemics at locations throughout the Indo-Pacific, even though total richness of the two groups is strongly correlated. The spatial separation of centres of endemicity and biodiversity hotspots in these taxa calls for a two-pronged management strategy to address conservation needs.

A number of them have been focused on interspecific competition for resources, mainly nutrients and light, and have stressed the role of the dispersal as a key mechanism in understanding community patterns. In our approach we introduced a cellular automaton computer model in an effort to quantify the community processes taking into account the spatial dimension of the problem of dispersal. We simulated the responses of natural communities to gap creation after a disturbance (e.g. fire) and looked at the resulting community dynamics. Our results showed that an increase of the biodiversity in the sense of adding more species in the species pool of the communities under study followed a positive response in our system viewed from a productivity point. Also the responses varied as disturbance intensity increased, indicating that species-specific characteristics could dominate the end communities.

Sabans traditionally fished on the Bank as far back as 1907, but increasing foreign fishing pressures on the Bank in the 1970s and 1980s forced many Saban fishermen out. Concerns were compounded by the suspicion that shipping was also damaging the benthic habitat of the bank. Fishery legislation, enacted in 1996, brought an end to unlicensed fishing and established Coast Guard enforcement on the Bank, but also led to protests from neighboring countries that previously fished on the Bank. Research was necessary to support the need for protection. Review of available research of Saba Bank and rapid biological assessments and fisheries surveys since 1996 emphasized the richness of Saba Bank's biodiversity and the need for protection of fisheries stocks. The national nature policy plan recognized this and encouraged further research to base conservation measures on. Recent biological surveys of corals, fishes, and algae presented in this collection of articles emphasized habitat heterogeneity and the relative richness of the marine flora and fauna. These assessments formed the basis for a management plan to protect Saba Bank's biodiversity and a draft proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) seeking Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) status for the Bank. The intention of the PSSA proposal is to protect the benthic habitat on Saba Bank from anchor damage. This paper serves to provide the context for the results of the recent biodiversity surveys of Saba Bank. It is hoped that this collection will serve as a knowledge baseline and engender further research in the area.

Although local people may be strongly affected by these decisions, there are problems related to external professionals' understanding of how such decisions might affect the livelihoods of local residents. And despite the worldwide move towards more 'participatory' methods, there are still problems in finding ways to consult local people to find out which areas they themselves would like to conserve.

Intercomparison of two major German project databases for interdisciplinary collaborative functional biodiversity research	Ecological Informatics	03/01/2012	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.11.004	9	Research on biodiversity, its relation to ecosystem functioning and services, and the assessment of the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity needs an interdisciplinary perspective. This implies a great diversity of data and data formats gathered mostly in short- to mid-term collaborative research projects. It has been common practice that projects develop specific data management and communication solutions. We compare solutions of two major German collaborative research programs in functional biodiversity research to derive functional commonalities. This in-depth analysis follows five categories of the data life cycle: (i) data acquisition, (ii) metadata management, (iii) database, (iv) exploration, analysis and visualization, and (v) data curation and preservation. The results show that even though both systems were developed completely independently, they reveal comparable overall features and a similar state of implementation. Major focus areas lie in the implementation of comparable metadata schemas and their importance for storage and access strategies for tabular data on the value level. Basic analysis tools and similar management functions are considered. Intensive communication with the users and the orientation of ongoing developments based on user requirements is also important. Both systems are different mostly in specific details which, however, do not influence the overall comparable performance. It should be also emphasized that the same functionality is achieved with completely different software. The choice of software is based on the evaluation of available technologies. Thereby it might be influenced by individual experiences of the developers, but is mainly determined by the data diversity, which forces the usage of flexible technologies to develop adaptable systems. It is concluded that overall features for project databases of collaborative research projects must be supplemented by sophisticated data description, storage, and analysis structures to serve the requirements of integrative functional biodiversity research.

The study was conducted in 2013 on six tributaries of the Upper Sukhona River. Five sampling sites were in different parts of the Vologda River and five sites on small rivers, Losta, Lukhta, Komya, Chernyj Shingar, and Belyj Shingar (one site per river). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos were sampled six times, from April to October, and macrophytes were studied in August. hi total, 469 species of aquatic organisms were found in the tributaries of the Upper Sukhona River, belonging to the following phyla: Cyanophyta (5 species), Chrysophyta (8), Bacillariophyta (62), Xanthophyta (1), Cryptophyta (10), Dinophyta (4), Euglenophyta (12), Chlorophyta (17), Streptophyta (1), Bryophyta (2), Marchantiophyta (3), Equisetophyta (1), Magnoliophyta (63), Rotifera (22), Cnidaria (1), Platyhelmintes (1), Annelida (29), Mollusca (33), Arthropoda (194). The maximum number of species was found in the Vologda River, the largest of all the tributaries. The number of zoobenthos species was similar at different sites in the Vologda River and in the small rivers. The number of species of other groups of aquatic organisms in the small rivers was lower than those registered in the Vologda River. The greatest number of macrophyte and zoobenthos species was recorded in the Upper Vologda River and Belyj Shingar River, where the flow is strong all the year round. The greatest number of phyto- and zooplankton species was found at the extra-city sites where current is almost absent hi the dam backwater, species richness was higher than that registered downstream of the dam. At the same time, the species richness of macrophytes and zoobenthos in the dam backwater was lower. The smallest number of species was found in the Vologda River, downstream of the city of Vologda. Decreases in the species richness and Shannon's biodiversity index were witnessed in the Vologda River city site and in the small rivers, as they get closer to the city. Cluster analyses performed for the studied groups of aquatic organisms showed dissimilar results; however, the studied sites on the Vologda River having the highest anthropogenic load formed a cluster. Aquatic organisms of the Upper Sukhona tributaries experience both natural (flow velocity and size of the watercourse) and anthropogenic factors (proximity to the city and flow regulation).

Plos One	10/19/2011	10.1371/journal.pone.0025762	19	The concept of biodiversity offsets is well established as an approach to environmental management. The concept has been suggested for environmental management in fisheries, particularly in relation to the substantial numbers of non-target species-seabirds in particular-caught and killed as incidental bycatch during fishing activities. Substantial areas of fisheries are being closed to protect these species at great cost to the fishing industry. However, other actions may be taken to offset the impact of fishing on these populations at lower cost to the fishing industry. This idea, however, has attracted severe criticism largely as it does not address the underlying externality problems created by the fishing sector, namely seabird fishing mortality. In this paper, we re-examine the potential role of compensatory mitigation as a fisheries management tool, although from the perspective of being an interim management measure while more long-lasting solutions to the problem are found. We re-model an example previously examined by both proponents and opponents of the approach, namely the cost effectiveness of rodent control relative to fishery area closures for the conservation of a seabird population adversely affected by an Australian tuna fishery. We find that, in the example being examined, invasive rodent eradication is at least 10 times more cost effective than area closures. We conclude that, while this does not solve the actual bycatch problem, it may provide breathing space for both the seabird species and the industry to find longer term means of reducing bycatch.

8061	WOS:000245934700006	Effects of cutting and nitrogen deposition on biodiversity in Cantabrian heathlands	Applied Vegetation Science	04/01/2007	NA	23	Questions: Does the diversity of heathland vegetation change when subjected to experimental disturbances such as cutting and nitrogen fertilization? Do changes in the vegetation structure negatively affect the regeneration of the dominant species Calluna vulgaris? Is cutting an alternative method of conserving the diversity and maintaining the structure of heathlands in the Canabrian Mountains? Location: Calluna vulgaris heathlands on the southern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountain range, NW Spain. Methods: A total of 60 plots were treated with different combinations of cutting and twice the estimated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (56 kg-N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). The changes in the cover values of the species present were monitored over a five year study period. The cover values were used to calculate abundance and species richness. Results: Fertilizing, with nitro-en allows biodiversity to increase over time. However, the greatest biodiversity is associated with the cutting plus fertilization treatment, since cutting allows gaps to be opened that are easily colonized by pioneer annual species, white fertilization mainly favours an increase in the mean number of perennial herbs (graminoids and forbs). Increased perennial herb richness also corresponds to a rise in their cover values. The recovery of the dominant woody species in these communities, Calluna vulgaris, is not impeded by the increase in perennial herbs species' cover values. Conclusions: In the Calluna vulgaris heathlands studied, cutting plus fertilization allowed an increase in biodiversity over time. No displacement of the dominant woody species, Calluna vulgaris, is observed due to the presence of the perennial herbs. Cutting patches of heathland is recommended as a mechanism for maintaining high vegetation diversity, when grazing is not possible.

Here we present the first global assessment of current and potential future impacts on biodiversity of a habitat loss and fragmentation-climate change (HLF-CC) interaction. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the negative impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation have been disproportionately severe in areas with high temperatures in the warmest month and declining rainfall, although impacts also varied across vegetation types. We compiled an integrated global database of past, current and future climate variables and past vegetation loss to identify ecoregions where (i) past climate change is most likely to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF, and (ii) forecasted climate change is most likely to exacerbate the impacts of HLF in the future. We found that recent climate change is likely (probability >66%) to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF in 120 (18.5%) ecoregions. Impacted ecoregions are disproportionately biodiverse, containing over half (54.1%) of all known terrestrial amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species. Forecasts from the RCP8.5 emissions scenario suggest that nearly half of ecoregions globally (n = 283, 43.5%) will become impacted during the 21st century. To minimize ongoing and future HLF-CC impacts on biodiversity, ecoregions where impacts are most likely must become priorities for proactive conservation actions that avoid loss of native vegetation (e.g., protected area establishment). Highly degraded ecoregions where impacts are most likely should be priorities for restoration and candidates for unconventional conservation actions (e.g. translocation of species).

The area has a long geologic history and a central biogeographic location with a complex circulation ensuring oceanographic connectivity with the Mediterranean Sea, equatorial and North Atlantic regions. The geodynamics of the region promotes a notorious diversity in the seep regime despite the relatively low fluxes of hydrocarbon-rich gases. We analyse quantitative samples taken during the cruises TTR14, TTR15 and MSM01-03 in seven mud volcanoes grouped into Shallow MVs (Mercator: 350 m, Kidd: 500 m, Meknes: 700 m) and Deep MVs (Captain Arutyunov: 1300 m, Carlos Ribeiro: 2200 m, Bonjardim: 3000 m, Porto: 3900 m) and two additional Reference sites (ca. 550 m). Macrofauna (retained by a 500 mu m sieve) was identified to species level whenever possible. The samples yielded modest abundances (70-1567 individuals per 0.25m(2)), but the local and regional number of species is among the highest ever reported for cold seeps. Among the 366 recorded species, 22 were symbiont-hosting bivalves (Thyasiridae, Vesicomyidae, Solemyidae) and tubeworms (Siboglinidae). The multivariate analyses supported the significant differences between Shallow and Deep MVs: The environmental conditions at the Shallow MVs make them highly permeable to the penetration of background fauna leading to high diversity of the attendant assemblages (H': 2.92-3.94; ES(100): 28.3-45.0; J': 0.685-0.881). The Deep MV assemblages showed, in general, contrasting features but were more heterogeneous (H': 1.41-3.06; ES(100): 10.5-30.5; J': 0.340-0.852) and often dominated by one or more siboglinid species. The rarefaction curves confirmed the differences in biodiversity of Deep and Shallow MVs as well as the convergence of the latter to the Reference sites. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity demonstrated the high beta-diversity of the assemblages, especially in pairwise comparisons involving samples from the Deep MVs. Diversity partitioning assessed for species richness, Hurlbert's expected number of species and Shannon-Wiener index confirmed the high beta-diversity across different spatial scales (within MVs, between MVs, between Deep and Shallow MVs). We suggest that historical and contemporary factors with differential synergies at different depths contribute to the high alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity of the mud volcano faunal assemblages in the Gulf of Cadiz.

This is a 725 km, largely forested, Paleozoic limestone escarpment that, excepting the Great Lakes, is the most prominent topographical feature of southern Ontario, Canada. Results show highly significant differences in mean site size and extent of forest interior among natural areas of different ownership classes, with larger and more forested sites being under mixed (private + public) ownership, but no significant difference between sites of public and private ownership. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that after controlling for differences in landscape-level factors (total size of natural area, extent of forest interior, extent of landform heterogeneity and geographic location), most measures of biotic diversity (including the number of vegetation community types, provincially rare vascular plants, and regionally and locally rare breeding birds) differed significantly among sites of private, public and mixed ownership. In general, values at public and mixed ownership sites were greatest, with significantly lower biodiversity values at privately-owned sites. Furthermore it would seem not to be a product of public bodies having historically purchased the largest sites or most-forested sites, since there is no significant difference between the mean size of publically-owned and privately-owned sites. Results of stepwise multiple regression confirm the well known relation between size of a natural area and variation in both total, and rare species diversity.

Market-based approaches can incentivize conservation behaviors on private lands by shifting the benefit-cost ratio of engaging in activities that result in net conservation benefits for target species. In the United States and elsewhere, voluntary conservation agreements with financial incentives are becoming an increasingly common strategy. While the influence of program design and delivery of voluntary conservation programs is often overlooked, these aspects are critical to achieving the necessary participation to attain landscape-scale outcomes. Using a sample of family-forest landowners in the southeast United States, we show how preferences for participation in a conservation program to protect an at-risk species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), are related to program structure, delivery, and perceived efficacy. Landowners were most sensitive to programs that are highly controlling, require permanent conservation easements, and put landowners at risk for future regulation. Programs designed with greater levels of compensation and that support landowners' autonomy to make land management decisions can increase participation and increase landowner acceptance of program components that are generally unfavorable, like long-term contracts and permanent easements. There is an inherent trade-off between maximizing participation and maximizing the conservation benefits when designing a conservation incentive program. For conservation programs targeting private lands to achieve landscape-level benefits, they must attract a critical level of participation that creates a connected mosaic of conservation benefits. Yet, programs with attributes that strive to maximize conservation benefits within a single agreement (and reduce risks of failure) are likely to have lower participation, and thus lower landscape benefits. Achieving levels of landowner participation in conservation agreement programs that deliver lasting, landscape-level benefits requires careful attention not only to how the program structure influences potential conservation benefits, but also how it influences landowners and their potential to participate.

We review recent evidence for the impacts of decentralization on the biodiversity values of forests and forested landscapes, which encompass most of the biodiversity of the tropics. Few studies document the impact of decentralized management on biodiversity. We conclude that there may be situations where local management is a good option for biodiversity but there are also situations where this is not the case. We advocate increased research to document the impact of local management on biodiversity. We also argue that locally managed forests should be seen as components of landscapes where governance arrangements favor the achievement of a balance between the local livelihood values and the global public goods values of forests.

Many prioritisation methods have been suggested at different spatial scales, including those based cn single-taxon criteria. One such scheme is BirdLife International's system of important bird areas (IBAs). Whilst IBA site qualification criteria are entirely bird-based, the intention is that these sites should conserve wider biodiversity. This idea has yet to be tested quantitatively, but a unique opportunity to do so exists in Uganda. where the Forest Department (FD) has conducted comprehensive inventories of five taxa. (birds, butterflies, large moths, small mammals and woody plants) in 50 Ugandan Forest Reserves. Independently, Nature Uganda (the national conservation NGO) identified 30 IBAs, 13 of which were also forest reserves. In this paper we used the FD dataset to evaluate the efficiency with which Uganda's forest IBAs capture species richness in other groups. In a combined area of 5445 km 2, Uganda's 13 forest IBAs contained as many species as did an equal-sized set of sites selected by applying a complementarity-based algorithm to all FD data. Modifying this simple greedy algorithm to take account of site area resulted in a priority set that outperformed IBAs, but that consisted of far more sites for similar species representation. Our results illustrate the utility of the IBA network for representing a wide range of biodiversity. A major benefit of IBAs is the low cost of obtaining bird data relative to comprehensive multi-taxon inventories. The general applicability of these results outside tropical forests requires further investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared the physicochemical and aquatic biodiversity characteristics of ditches, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams in five locations in Europe in three biogeographic zones. At the individual site level (alpha diversity), rivers were found to be the most species-rich waterbodies; however, at the regional level (gamma diversity), ponds were the most species-rich aquatic habitat for both wetland plants and macroinvertebrates. In terms of rare species, ponds also had a higher rarity value, measured by a Species Rarity Index, than other habitat types, although data for this analysis were only available from the United Kingdom. The high biodiversity values of ponds suggest that they should be more central to strategies for the protection and management of aquatic biodiversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relationships between traditional grazing and farming activities and biodiversity were analysed by comparing species richness and temporal turnover across three different habitat types, defined according to vegetation structure and human land use. In this study, both spatial (landscape, among-habitats) and temporal (intra-annual, seasonal) analyses were contemplated at mesoscale. The measurement and use of temporal beta diversity (i.e. an index of temporal species turnover) in conservation biology showed that it is a simple method to characterize and compare different habitat species-assemblages, particularly when time seems to be a significant factor in explaining biodiversity features. Our results showed open mosaic areas as the richest and most temporally heterogeneous habitats. We suggest the maintenance of traditional human activities carried out in these areas, since they have been a significant diversification agent, to avoid the loss of the high Mediterranean biological diversity.

In view of this fact, the present study aims to understand the similarities in plant species distribution and their ethnobotanical uses in the Indian Himalayas and the Slovenian Alps. The plant species common in both the mountain systems and used by local inhabitants were compiled by extensive literature search and also by carrying out primary surveys. Ethnobotanical information was collected through personal interviews of villagers with the help of local assistants and also through direct and indirect observations made during the field surveys. A total of 59 ethnobotanical species representing 17 families common in both the Indian Himalayas and the Slovenian Alps were documented, of these 78% obtained medicinal properties and traditionally used by local people for curing diseases. Comparatively, people of the Indian Himalayas used plants for medicine in higher percentage (73%) than the people of Slovenia (42%). Of the total medicinal plants, only 7 plant species such as Acorus calamus, Capsella bursa-partoris, Hypericum perforatum, Origanum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris, Solanum nigrum and Urtica dioica had some common uses in both the Slovenian Alps and the Indian Himalayas. In the Slovenian Alps, the maximum ethnobotanical species (61%) had wide distribution range whereas maximum ethnobotanical species in the Indian Himalayas (62%) had localized distribution. Though, 27% of common ethnobotanical species belonged to different threat categories, only 2 species-Taxus baccata and Hippophae rhamnoides-are placed under similar threat category in these two different mountain areas. The study unfolds relationship in plant species distribution and their ethnobotanical uses along with offering an opportunity to provide information on uses of plant species though available but unknown to community.

As a result, in Mediterranean ecosystems a loss of biodiversity is usually related to a decrease of grassland and grassland-bush mosaic areas. In order to establish relationships between land use and the relative importance of each type of habitat in terms of species richness and endemicity, the Font Roja Natural Park in Alicante Province (SE Iberian Peninsula) was studied. Four sites were selected representing the four different existing habitats: a wooded area (holm-oak forest), a dense shrubland, a dense grassland, and a grassland-shrubland mosaic area. In each site, the species composition of vegetation and dung beetle fauna were analysed. The results showed that the highest diversity and endemicity, for plants and beetles, were concentrated in the dense grasslands and the grassland-shrubland mosaic. Thus, controlled grazing activity of sheep and goats which maintained a diverse variegated landscape would favour the historical sustenance of the biodiversity of Mediterranean ecosystems, as that would allow a remarkable diversity of habitats with higher conservation levels of existing species richness and endemicity. Therefore, we propose a reintroduction of traditional grazing of sheep and goats throughout ecological, cultural and economical measures, which would include guidelines and regulations, set out to boost an integrated rural policy.

We evaluated the effects of renewed grazing and cutting management carried out across a whole region, on the diversity of plants and seven arthropod groups. Changes in occurrence over 17 years of intensive calcareous grassland management were analysed at the species level, which gave insight into the exact species contributing to regional homogenization or differentiation. Reponses were compared between species differing in habitat affinity, dispersal ability, food specialisation and trophic level. Local species richness increased over the sampling period for true bugs and millipedes, while carabid beetles and weevils declined in local species richness. Species richness remained unchanged for plants, woodlice, ants and spiders. Regional diversity and compositional variation generally followed local patterns. Diversity shifts were only to a limited extent explained by species' habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic level and food specialisation. We conclude that implementation of relatively uniform conservation management across a region did not lead to uniform changes in local species composition. This is an encouraging result for conservation managers, as it shows that there is not necessarily a conflict of interest between local and regional conservation goals. Our study also demonstrates that shifts in diversity patterns differ markedly between taxonomic groups. Single traits provide only limited understanding of these differences. This highlights the need for a wide taxonomic scope when evaluating conservation management and demonstrates the need to understand the mechanisms underlying occurrence shifts.	van Noordwijk, C. G.

Additionally, it is also one of the most important sources of livelihood for different kinds of stakeholders at various levels of resource markets-local, domestic, or international. With globalization and increasing sophistication in the methods of commercial trade in biological resources, various issues arise related to the sustenance of resources, of ecological balances, and equity in transactions. All of these are concerns to be addressed to achieve a state of 'sustainability.' This paper prescribes to the definition of 'sustainability' as the capacity to maintain a certain process or state for ""improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems'' (IUCN/UNEP/WWF, in Caring for the Earth: a strategy for sustainable living. Gland, Switzerland, 1991). This goes beyond ensuring inter- and intragenerational equity in access to resources and includes several other parameters, including equity among stakeholders to returns from biological resources, related knowledge, trade-offs, and ethical business practices related to these resources. Through the prism of an examination of a simplistic supply route(s) and value addition chain of biodiversity resources for commercial use, this paper reviews and highlights issues related to 'sustainability' at each stage. Evidence points to shortcomings in the sustainable use of biological resources at each stage of value addition, calling for focused and specific measures to address them."	Suneetha, M.

The 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' suggests that disturbance regimes generate predictable non-linear patterns in species richness. Evidence often contradicts intermediate disturbance hypothesis at small scales, and is generally lacking at large regional scales. Here, we present the largest extent study of human impacts on boreal plant biodiversity to date. Disturbance extent ranged from 0 to 100% disturbed in vascular plant communities, varying from intact forest to agricultural fields, forestry cut blocks and oil sands. We show for the first time that across a broad region species richness peaked in communities with intermediate anthropogenic disturbance, as predicted by intermediate disturbance hypothesis, even when accounting for many environmental covariates. Intermediate disturbance hypothesis was consistently supported across trees, shrubs, forbs and grasses, with temporary and perpetual disturbances. However, only native species fit this pattern; exotic species richness increased linearly with disturbance.	Mayor, S. J. ; Cahill, J.

The fisheries and conservation benefits of alternative reserve designs would ideally be assessed using dynamic models, which consider spillover of fish and larvae to fished areas, and the displacement of fishers to unprotected sites. In practice, however, decisions about the location of marine reserves generally rely on cheaper and faster static models. Static models analyze only spatial patterns in habitats, and typically assume fisheries profits are reduced by the amount that was generated in areas designated as reserves. To help determine the benefits of developing dynamic fisheries models, we assessed how well static models estimate costs of reserve systems to fisheries and how outcomes from reserves designed using either static or dynamic models differ. We tested these questions in two case studies, the network of marine protected areas in southern California, USA and the proposed Tun Mustapha Marine Park in Malaysia. Static models could either under or over-estimate the cost of reserve plans to fisheries, depending on the relative importance of fisher movement and larval dispersal dynamics. Despite the inaccuracy of static models for estimating costs, reserves designed using static models were similar to those designed with dynamic models if fisheries were well managed; or larval dispersal networks were simple. If larval networks were complex or there was overfishing, dynamic models generated substantially different reserve networks from static models, which improved conservation outcomes by up to 10% and fishing profits by up 20%. The time-scale of management was also important, because only dynamic models accounted for larval dispersal, so could find reserves that maximized the long-term benefits of larval spillover. Our case studies provide quantitative support for the assertion that static models can be useful for planning marine reserves for short-term objectives in well managed fisheries, but are not reliable for evaluating the relative costs of reserves to fisheries.

In forestry, the consideration of some stand features such as requiring a certain volume of deadwood and/or large trees as a part of the management regime may help to preserve and enhance biodiversity. However, it is likely to lead to a decrease in the benefits obtained from timber sales. This chapter presents a bioeconomic model that allows the optimal selective logging regime of a size-distributed forest to be determined, while taking climate change and biodiversity into account. It analyzes to what extent structural targets related to biodiversity affect the optimal forest management regime and the profitability of forests. For this purpose, an empirical analysis under various climate change scenarios is conducted for two diameter-distributed stands of Pinus sylvestris in Catalonia. The results show that the costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of reduced profitability can be significant, and augment with climate change.

On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM. Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p < 0.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment.

At the global scale, it is widely recognized that SR and PD are strongly correlated, but the extent to which either tends to capture variation in TD is unclear. Here, we assess relationships among PD, SR and TD for a number of traits both across clades and regional assemblages of mammals. We also contrast results using two different measures of TD, trait variance and a new measure we refer to as trait bin filling (the number of orders of magnitude of variation that contain at least one species). When TD is defined as trait variance, PD is a much stronger correlate of TD than SR across clades, consistent with hypotheses about the conservation value of PD. However, when TD is defined as bin filling, PD and SR show similar correlations with TD across clades and space. We also investigate potential losses of SR, PD and TD if species that are currently threatened were to go extinct, and find that threatened PD is often a similar predictor of threatened TD as SR.

Being a synthetic discipline, it is primarily 'fed' by the established fields of biological sciences, such as taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, evolution, genetics, and the like. Taxonomy, which essentially deals with discovery, description and classification of living organisms, underpins the basic understanding of biodiversity on Earth. The vast knowledge base generated through the theory and practice of taxonomy endows scientists in particular and the public in general with a precious password key, for free, which unlocks gates to unravel, understand and utilise the hidden treasure trove of biodiversity on the globe. Recognising this, the present paper attempts to highlight the inherent interface between the fields of taxonomy (already existing) and biodiversity science (recently emerging). We first explore the various indispensable roles of taxonomy in accomplishing challengeable goals of the documentation, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The paper then highlights the current problems that need to be surmounted urgently, and finally sketches the future challenges to be met upfront, for a more productive interface between taxonomy and biodiversity sciences.

This study was intended to investigate the changes in grassland community in response to protection and forest tree plantation practice as well as to explore the underlying environmental gradients responsible for the observed differences or similarities among these vegetation types. Two multivariate analysis methods including discriminate analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling were used to quantify changes in community composition and attributes following different management practices (free grazing, protection with open grassland, sparse and dense forest tree plantations). This was investigated using species frequency, species abundance, or habitat characteristics. The study results showed that habitat types differed significantly between each other and were significantly separated using multivariate approaches. Discrimination based on habitat characteristics and species composition indicated that protection (or grazing) and light (or shade) explained more than 90% of the observed variability in community changes in response to the protection and forest tree plantation. Also, results indicated that shade effect can be attributed to tree canopy cover and/or litter accumulation on the ground. It could be hypothesized that protection from grazing and afforestation resulted in complex environmental gradients of which shade, litter accumulation as well as protection from grazing disturbance are major constituents. A careful manipulation of protection and afforestation can be used to create a spatially different environmental gradients leading to greater habitat diversity as well as a greater species diversity, and better conservation means of grassland in semi-arid areas.

Plant species biodiversity and evenness were greatest in lightly- and moderately-grazed pastures. Both pastures were dominated by the warm-season shortgrass Bouteloua gracilis, but the cool-season midgrasses Pascopyrum smithii and Stipa comata contributed significantly to biomass production on the lightly-grazed pasture, as they did in the exclosures. Diversity was least in the exclosures, which were strongly dominated by the cactus Opuntia polyacantha. Buchloe dactyloides, another warm-season shortgrass, and Bouteloua gracilis were co-dominants under heavy grazing, and diversity was intermediate. Plant community structure and diversity were controlled by selective grazing by cattle and soil disturbance by cattle and rodents. Shortgrass steppe moderately or heavily grazed by cattle was similar to and probably as sustainable as steppe grazed for millenia by bison and other wild ungulates.

The species forms dense three-dimensional matrices which constitute a microhabitat for a wide variety of organisms. Here we test the hypothesis that factors determining habitat Structural complexity and environmental heterogeneity of Perumytilus matrices have significant effects oil the associated macrofaunal community. In total we found 92 invertebrate taxa in P. purpuratus matrices. The number of layers (stratification) in the matrix had a significant effect on evenness: the greater the stratification, the lower the evenness index. Sediment retention by matrices in sheltered sectors had a significant effect on evenness: greater sediment retention resulted in lower evenness. Sediment retention also determined significant differences In macrofaunal assemblages. In matrices Without sediment retention, mussel layering and the presence of algae on the shells of P. purpuratus determined significant macrofaunal differences. As a dominant competitor, P. purpuratus plays a major role in intertidal rocky shores where it is present, structuring communities and determining local biodiversity.

Ponds in watersheds with more than 30% lawn cover have few zooplankton species, no macrophytes, no snails, and no amphibians. A recent meta-analysis generated the hypothesis that watershed (catchment basin) land cover is a better predictor of lake biodiversity than traditional predictors (such as in-lake primary productivity) if the watershed includes human development (agriculture, residential, or urban). This hypothesis was tested via a field survey of 23 similar-sized artificial ponds in southern Wisconsin. The ponds had similar climate and geology, but differed in the relative proportions of land cover in the watershed. Twelve environmental variables (including pond area, depth, and primary productivity surrogates) and seven watershed land cover variables were correlated with biodiversity measures of seven major aquatic communities. Percent lawn cover was negatively correlated with zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.41), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 61), molluscan presence (r(2) = 0.48), and amphibian presence (r(2) = 0.55 for spring species and r(2) = 0.78 for summer species). Fish presence was negatively correlated with percent watershed covered by meadow (r(2) = 0.16). Chlorophyll a (a primary productivity surrogate) was negatively correlated with three groups: zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.18), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 0.23), and molluscan presence/absence (r(2) = 0.31). Total phosphorus and nitrogen (surrogates of in-lake primary productivity) were weakly correlated with biodiversity.

The context within which they operate can change rapidly and dramatically. As a result, they need to plan new strategies, and do so by taking up the challenges of strategic design like any institutionalised organization. However, the specific characteristics and situations of ENGOs call for new, relevant approaches to strategic analysis and design. Based on successive cycles of case studies and conceptual work drawing on the biodiversity and strategic management literatures, the present paper proposes a new framework to articulate four fundamental dimensions of ENGOs' strategy: the choice of goals in terms of ecological priorities; the choice of how to act and press for change; the development of capacity (i.e. organization, internal governance and resources); and finally, a strategy to manage an often ambivalent mix of competition and cooperation with other ENGOs. The value of the framework is illustrated here by a case study of the French NGO 'Humanit, et Biodiversit,' (mankind and biodiversity), with dramatic changes in strategy to match and major strategic organizational challenges to be identified and resolved.

Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales.

Despite much evidence of land-use impacts on freshwater biodiversity, long-term changes to groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and their post-disturbance recovery, remain largely milmown. We examined long-term changes of bryophyte communities in 34 boreal springs from 1987 to 2015. In 1987, all the study springs were in near-pristine condition, but 29 of them were disturbed by peatland drainage in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Five sites retained their natural status throughout the study and were used as reference sites. We aimed to assess whether bryophyte vegetation, particularly spring specialist bryophytes, showed gradual recovery toward near-pristine conditions or whether the drainage-induced habitat degradation had caused delayed extinctions of specialists, leading to dominance by generalist taxa. Bryophyte diversity showed no signs of recovery about 20 years since the initial disturbance. In disturbed springs, the abundance of specialists first decreased, then remained relatively stable. Specialist richness decreased steadily and their community composition shifted gradually from the pre-disturbance state. Abundance of habitat generalists did not change but generalist richness also decreased with a time lag. At the same time, both groups remained unaltered in undisturbed springs. We conclude that without restoration measures that improve groundwater hydrology the self-recovery potential of springs is very low. As little is currently known about the effectiveness of spring restoration in halting spring biodiversity loss, the safest management strategy is to refrain from land use within broad buffers around springs.

Increased anthropogenic interventions into. the natural landscape have carved out separate niche in the biosphere by modifying the ecosystems drastically. In the process we have been loosing biodivenity at faster rate than expected. Hence, sustainable management of our biological resources has become key issue for survival of planet earth. Space has provided holistic view to the planet earth. The satellite remote sensing has enabled to map and monitor vegetation resources in varying scale and time. The geographic information system enables to organize the data sets for analysis and decision making process. India has Made significant efforts to build state of art satellite systems and develop applications to manage the natural resources.' Forest vegetation mapping and biodiversity characterisation at landscape level using satellite remote sensing technology is already an operational tool. Under a national scientific initiative India has developed comprehensive data base on vegetation types, fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness at landscape level in the important ecoregions of the country. This has been achieved by integrating the geospatial information on biological, physical, environmental, social and knowledge base. Remote sensing from space has facilitated systematic and hierarchical approach of biodiversity assessment and its monitoring. Hence biodiversity conservation strategy must include the information for defining the action.

Tropical agriculture, particularly intensive agriculture, often supports few native organisms, and consequently has been largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet, recent work in the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain features can support significant biodiversity, decades after conversion to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here, we quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in southwest India, a region continuously cultivated for >2,000 years. We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems retain 90% of the bird species associated with regional native forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First, the system involves intercropping with multiple, usually woody, understory species and, thus, has high vertical structural complexity that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second, the system encompasses nearby forests, where large quantities of leaf litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to arecanut cultivation. The long-term biodiversity value of an agricultural ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops. Some of these working lands may be able to sustain native species over long-time scales, indicating that conservation investments in agriculture today could pay off for people and for nature.

In this study we show the utility of combining the concepts and methodologies developed within the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research program with J. H. Connell and R. O. Slatyer's classic framework to understand succession in assemblages where multiple interactions between early and late colonists may include both inhibitory and facilitative effects. We assessed the net effect of multiple species interactions on successional changes by manipulating the richness, composition, and abundance of early colonists in a low-shore assemblage of algae and invertebrates of the northwestern Mediterranean. Results revealed how concomitant changes in species richness and abundance can strongly alter the net effect of inhibitory vs. facilitative interactions on succession. Increasing richness of early colonists inhibited succession, but only under high levels of initial abundance, probably reflecting the formation of a highly intricate matrix that prevented further colonization. In contrast, increasing initial abundance of early colonists tended to facilitate succession under low richness. Thus, changes in abundance of early colonists mediated the effects of richness on succession.

Archives Des Sciences	01/12/2004	NA	21	The European Directive on urban wastewater treatment voted in 1991, compelled industries to deal with their wastewater As a result, highways companies had to dig stormwater detention ponds alongside roads mainly in order to catch and treat road runoff. These stormwater ponds were quickly and largely colonised by aquatic organisms while they were only designed for a technical purpose. But if many of them have been dug all over Europe, their use by wildlife remains poorly studied. This article aims at taking stock of the role of highway stormwater detention ponds for biodiversity by (i) reviewing the knowledge on the chemical contamination found into it and (ii) addressing the problem of the use of these stormwater ponds by wildlife. The discussion is based on a survey conducted during one year (2002 - 2003) on six highway stormwater detention ponds situated in south-eastern France.

Although we found a positive relationship between production in monoculture and dominance in mixtures as predicted by the SEH, the relationship had low explanatory power. Counter to predictions, the species with the highest monoculture biomass were not able to strongly dominate all mixtures; instead the dominance of these species decreased with increasing species richness. On average, polycultures did not achieve greater biomass than (transgressively overyield) the species in each mixture, or at each site, that was most productive in monoculture. However, mixture yields did transgressively overyield both the monoculture biomass of the dominant species in the mixtures, and the weighted average of all monocultures (non-transgressive overyielding), both of which were positively related to increasing species richness. The varying responses of different overyielding tests resulted because resource partitioning and positive interactions were often counter-balanced by selection for species with lower biomass than the highest-yielding monocultures. Judging whether or not mixtures overyield therefore depends in part upon which species is the basis for comparison. We present a new general framework for overyielding analysis where every monoculture provides a potential comparison and from which the most relevant tests can be selected.

However, standard protocols for ecological risk assessments use endpoints that are not directly related to biodiversity. In the present study, the changes in five biodiversity indicators, namely, the Hill, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity index, AZTI's Marine Benthic Index (AMBI), and Benthic Quality Index (BQI), are calculated in case species experience direct chemical effects. This is done for an uncontaminated situation as well as for situations in which the effect concentration of a certain fraction of species (x%) is exceeded, that is, at the hazardous concentration (HCx) of the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of the considered community. Results indicate that the response of the biodiversity indicators to concentrations spanning the complete concentration range of the SSD is variable. This response depends mainly on the type of indicator, the species assemblage, and the ratio of the slope of the concentration effect curves of the species and the slope of the SSD. At the HC5, a commonly used threshold in environmental risk assessment, biodiversity indicators, are affected at a marginal level (change is less than 5% in 99.6% of the simulated cases). Based on the results, the HC5 level is likely to be a protective threshold for changes in biodiversity in terms of richness and heterogeneity in the vast majority of the simulated cases (99.6%) for chemicals for which direct effects are dominant.

Emphasis was on long-term societal and environmental benefits in addition to financial gain for the company. The systematic, cyclical adaptive management process was used to generate feedback for SPDP managers. Adaptive management enables ongoing improvement of management policies and practices based on lessons learned from operational activities. Previous to this study, very little information about the local biodiversity was available. Over a 2-year period, the team conducted biological assessments of six taxonomic groups at five sites located within 600 km(2). A broad range of management options such as location, timing and technology were developed from the beginning of the project. They were considered in conjunction with emerging lessons from the biodiversity assessments. Critical decisions included location of a gas plant and the cost of helicopter access versus roads to service the full field development. Both of these decisions were evaluated to ensure that they were economically and environmentally feasible. Project design changes, addressed in the planning stage, were accepted once consensus was achieved. Stakeholders were apprised of the implications of the baseline biodiversity assessments.

We identified influences of site conditions and management type on grassland biodiversity, and specifically evaluated the effectiveness of the agri-environmental programme in the Alps. Vascular plants and grasshoppers were mapped in conventionally managed cut meadows, cut meadows of the ecological compensation programme (ECA meadows), and conventionally managed pastures (n = 324). We determined climatic and topographic site conditions, quantified the degree of remoteness of all plots in GIS, and estimated the habitat diversity in the vicinity of the sampling sites. The data were analysed by discriminant analysis, rank-correlation analysis, non-parametric ANOVA, general linear models, and ANCOVA. Plant biodiversity hot spots were in economically unattractive, remote sites. These were the typical site conditions of ECA meadows. Hence we concluded that the ecological compensation programme was effectively ensuring management at these sites, and thus protecting mountain grassland plant species richness. Grasshoppers seemed not to benefit from mountain ECA meadows, which were probably often situated at the climatic limit of several species. Pastures were the most species rich management type (plants and grasshoppers), but conversion from cut grassland to pastures should be limited, as negative economic and ecological effects have been reported. We propose that the co-existence of well-managed pastures and long-term ECA meadows might best conserve mountain grassland biodiversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In 1992, the EU provided the member states with its Agri-environment Regulation 2078/92 to help member states reverse these developments by means of agri-environment schemes. The question is: will the implementation of these schemes be sufficient to restore the biological diversity on farmland? Most studies that have examined the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes have focussed on farmland birds in Great Britain and The Netherlands. So far, the positive effects appear to be limited. Continuous evaluation and adaptation of these schemes is needed to enable the biodiversity on farmland to recover from the EU's former policy.

Location The Atlantic forest, stretching along the Brazilian coast. Methods We model the spatial range of the forest under three climatic scenarios (current climate, 6000 and 21,000 years ago) with BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Historically stable areas or refugia are identified as the set of grid cells for which forest presence is inferred in all models and time projections. To validate inferred refugia, we test whether our models are matched by the current distribution of the forest and by fossil pollen data. We then investigate whether the location of inferred forest refugia is consistent with current patterns of species endemism and existing phylogeographical data. Results Forest models agree with pollen records and predict a large area of historical forest stability in the central corridor (Bahia), as well as a smaller refuge (Pernambuco) along the Brazilian coast, matching current centres of endemism in multiple taxa and mtDNA diversity patterns in a subset of the species examined. Less historical stability is predicted in coastal areas south of the Doce river, which agrees with most phylogeographical studies in that region. Yet some widely distributed taxa show high endemism in the southern Atlantic forest. This may be due to limitations of the modelling approach, differences in ecology and dispersal capability, historical processes not contemplated by the current study or inadequacy of the available test data sets. Main conclusions Palaeoclimatic models predict the presence of historical forest refugia in the Atlantic rain forest and suggest spatial variation in persistence of forests through the Pleistocene, predicting patterns of biodiversity in several local taxa. The results point to the need for further studies to document genetic and species endemism in the relatively poorly known and highly impacted areas of Atlantic rain forests of north-eastern Brazil.

LocationMadagascar and Indian Ocean Islands. MethodsWe conducted phylogenetic analyses with plastid and nuclear DNA sequences of Primulaceae using maximum likelihood and Bayesian algorithms, and estimated divergence times using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock. Temporal changes in diversification rate and possible correlations with the biogeographical history of the group were examined. We performed parametric ancestral area reconstruction incorporating a stratified palaeogeographical model that reflects changes in terrestrial configuration and the presence of phytogeographical connections through time in the western Indian Ocean Basin. Shifts in diversification rate were compared with ancestral area assignments and divergence age estimates. ResultsIndian Ocean Primulaceae were recovered as monophyletic with a sister relationship to Asian Ardisia. Oncostemum, a genus confined to Madagascar and the Comoros, was resolved as paraphyletic by the inclusion of a monophyletic Mascarene Badula group consisting of single-island endemics. We found evidence for diversification bursts early in the history of Indian Ocean Primulaceae that correspond closely to the sequence of dispersal and the appearance of newly formed Mascarene Islands. Age estimates suggest a dispersal to Rodrigues that is older than the estimated geological age of the island. Main conclusionsResults suggest a Madagascan origin of Indian Ocean Primulaceae with subsequent dispersal to the Mascarenes in the middle to late Miocene, with initial establishment on either Mauritius or Rodrigues and subsequent stepping-stone dispersal to the other two Mascarene islands within the last 2Myr. Analyses suggest that diversification has slowed over time, with significant rate changes following dispersal to new geographical areas. Onset of diversification in species-rich Oncostemum appears to have been recent, with major cladogenesis commencing in the early Pliocene.

Here we review the history and activities of AP-BON (Asia-Pacific Biodiversity Observation Network), an active network of biodiversity observation in the Asia-Pacific region. AP-BON was organized in 2009, 1 year earlier than CBD COP 10 in 2010, and developed through four workshops and additional related meetings. The most recent, the fourth, AP-BON workshop was held in 2011, wherein implementation for 20122015 was confirmed. Major activities planned for 2012-2015 are (1) editing and networking the national biodiversity outlook, (2) publication of additional AP-BON books, (3) promotion of collaborative projects, (4) development of a shared database, and (5) capacity building. As for the third activity, implementation for 20122015 has been developed in five working groups (WGs). WG 1 (genetics/phylogenetic diversity) is promoting genetic diversity assessment to contribute to a GEO BON genetic diversity report. WG 2 is carrying out plant diversity assessments using a standardized transect method in Southeast (SE) Asian countries. WG 3 (terrestrial ecosystem) is developing (1) networks of in situ monitoring and a database on terrestrial ecosystems, (2) a database on function and services of terrestrial ecosystems, and (3) maps of biodiversity, function, and ecosystem services. WG 4 (freshwater) is monitoring Asian freshwater biodiversity at the genus, species, and ecosystem levels, focusing on fish and aquatic plants. WG 5 (marine) is developing a database to share biodiversity information and collecting data on kelp forests, seagrass meadows, coral reefs, pelagic water, and the deep sea. An important role of AP BON is to network these projects by providing opportunities for communication and interaction, developing tools for data collection, sharing, analysis, and synthesis, and carrying out assessments helpful for improving ecosystem management and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the intraspecific level remains poorly understood, particularly in eastern Antarctica. We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two sibling amphipod species that could be collected on a circum-Antarctic scale: Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus. Haplotype networks and Bayesian phylogenies based on mitochondrial (COI, CytB) and nuclear (ITS2) DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of Eusirus, with several occurring in sympatry and at least one likely to have a true circum- Antarctic distribution. Within species, gene flow was often highly restricted, consistent with a brooding life history and in some cases suggestive of current or future allopatric speciation. Patterns of genetic structure were not always predictable: one cryptic species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation across similar to 150 km in eastern Antarctica (F-ST > 0.47, P < 0.01), yet another was remarkably homogenous across similar to 5000 km (F-ST = 0.00, P = 1.00). Genetic diversity also varied among cryptic species, independent of sample size (pi = 0.00-0.99). These results indicate several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic amphipods that are neither apparent from previous taxonomic or ecological studies nor predictable from their life history. Such genetic diversity and structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic benthic organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent re-establishment of populations on the shelf, and highlight our misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species diversity.

Previous culture-independent studies demonstrated that similar to15% of all Bacillus 16S rDNA directly extracted from soils worldwide was affiliated to B. niacini. Seven different media were inoculated with soil suspensions in serial dilutions and incubated at different temperatures. Then, bacterial colonies were picked and analyzed by sequencing. A mineral medium with acetate as carbon source yielded a B. niacini rate of >3% of all picked colonies. Other media were less efficient but also successful. Applying this culturing approach, we succeeded in obtaining 64 isolates from different Dutch soils. The isolates turned out to be diverse, although closely related to B. niacini as revealed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Close matches with environmental clones were also found, thus demonstrating much more diversity beyond previously known 16S rDNA sequences. The rep-PCR fingerprinting method revealed a high genomic variety, redundancy could not be observed among our isolates. Hence, the hitherto neglected B. niacini lineage, apparently among the most abundant soil Bacillus, was accessible to our cultivation approach.

The diversity of source (glacier-fed [GF], snow-fed [SN] and spring-fed [SF]) and stream-size (both interrelated) across the altitudinal panorama, create numerous habitats that contribute to structural diversity. The spatial patterns in richness, density and taxonomic composition and distribution of benthic diatoms are less affected by source compared with macro-invertebrates but shows strong influence on the distribution of fish fauna that are poikiliotherms, because a glacier-fed river carries ice-cold water (usually <20 degrees C) in contrast to normal waters in spring-fed system (22 degrees C near snowline, 32 degrees C in foothills). The abundance patterns of biota of lower organisation grade (diatoms, macro-invertebrates) do not differ sharply even across distant river basins as they are more influenced by proximate factors; thus the sub-basins of the Alaknanda resemble more by virtue of one basin and there is notable resemblance between distant SF Bemunda (lower Ganga basin) and SF Gomti (East Rmgang basin) and even the farthest Yamuna and Rmgang. Fish are more sensitive to temperature and current velocities that are related to altitude and hence longitudinal rather than the spatial gradients in the mountains. The lotic ecosystem of Doon Valley harbour rich and diverse diatom flora, macroinvertebrate fauna and ichthyofauna. The examination of trophic, saprobic and ecological status shows that organic pollution, degradation and anthropogenic eutrophication are non-existent in the Lesser Himalayan rivers and streams, but the fragile Doon Valley is under severe anthropogenic stress. This and habitats fragmented by hydropower projects in the major rivers has threatened the iconic game fish Himalayan mahseer in the Ganga.

1361	WOS:000270849400008	A Long-term Perspective on Biodiversity and Marine Resource Exploitation in Fiji's Lau Group	Pacific Science	01/10/2009	NA	18	I present research investigating biodiversity and human interaction with the local environment through three perspectives on diverse islands in Fiji's Lau Group. First, I generated long-term data on marine diversity and exploitation through zooarchaeological analyses of fauna from sites spanning the region's prehistoric human occupation. The study areas are representative of regional fauna and local geographic variation in island size and structure. Each island also varies in terms of human occupation and degree of impacts on marine and terrestrial environments. Second, my ethnographic work recorded modern marine exploitation patterns by Lauan communities. Third, marine biological surveys documented living faunas. Together this information is used to explore the marine environment over the three millennia of human occupation. Using data derived from my multipronged study I discuss potential causes of ecological change in this tropical marine setting. My, findings include the following: (1) data indicate that relative intensity of human Occupation and exploitation determines modern composition and biological diversity of marine communities because human disturbance occurred more extensively on larger islands than on smaller islands in Lau; (2) Lauans appear to have targeted similar suites of marine fauna across their 3,000 years of history on these islands; (3) Lauans have had a selective effect on marine biodiversity because particular species are/were targeted according to local standards of ranking and preference; (4) marine resources existing today have withstood over 3,000 years of human impacts and therefore may have life history traits supporting resilience and making conservation efforts worthwhile.

In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffets and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of ""best management practices"" (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help. conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival."

Moreover, it could be valuable to know what additional threats may arise from continued human population growth. Here we quantify a model of the relationship between human population density and the number of threatened mammal and bird species by nation. Our multiple regression analysis revealed that two predictor variables, human population density and species richness (of birds and mammals), account for 88% of the variability in log-transformed densities of threatened species across 114 continental nations. Using the regression model with projected population sizes of each nation, we found that the number of threatened species in the average nation is expected to increase 7% by 2020, and 14% by 2050, as forecast by human population growth alone. Our findings strongly support the notion that abating human population growth is a necessary, if not sufficient, step in the epic attempt to conserve biodiversity on the global scale.

Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Taita Hills Cloud Forest (THCF) in Kenya remains one of the top biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Environmental data for the area has been studied for decades. Sociodemographic analyses on inequality have been conducted by governmental and non-governmental organizations. Little has been done yet to correlate them to investigate their relationships. A lot of attention has been paid to the connection between agricultural practices and impacts on the environment, but human-environment relationships are much more complex, especially in Kenya's biodiversity-rich areas. This paper assesses the local population's perception of its surrounding environment and investigates their understanding of nature conservation. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, 300 survey respondents were classified concerning their nature ethical views (particularly anthropocentrism and ecocentrism). By using grounded theory, data were regularly reviewed during the entire research, to assemble an evaluable and comparable dataset. Our study reveals that gender has a distinct impact on whether the interviewees have an anthropocentric or ecocentric perspective of nature and conservation. Moreover, there is a strong need for an intermediate bridge between anthropocentrism and ecocentrism.

On the basis of the detailed characteristic of the ecological conditions the data for distribution of the natural vegetation in different thermo-climate belts are presented and in accordance with these data our country has the following belts: alpine, sub-alpine, high-mountain, middle-mountain, and low-mountain and zonal afore-mountain belt. The forest growing zones are differentiated in Zone of Pinus mugo, Zone of Picea abies and Pinus peuce, Zone of Fagus sylvatica and conifers, Zone of Quercus species. There are three forest-growing belts, respectively high-mountain forest-growing belt, middle mountain belt of beech and coniferous forests, where the beech forests are widespread, lower plain-hilled and hill-fore-mountain belt of oak forests and each have three sub-belts. This study shows actual information for the distribution and natural renovation of the main forest types in Bulgaria. There are indicated the basic forest trees, forming the structure of the natural forest ecosystems according altitude and soil-climatic conditions. In the structure of the natural forests the species Picea abies (L.) K a r s t., Pinus sylvestris L., Abies alba M i I I., Fagus sylvatica L., Carpinus betulus L., Quercus petraea L i e b L, Quercus cerris L., Quercus pubescens W i I I d. and in rare occasions Quercus robur L., Quercus coccifera L., Quercus hartwissiana S t e v. with their companion species prevail from the high to the lower parts of the country.

Traditional hypotheses that account for such exceptional biodiversity have highlighted the importance of environmental variables such as habitat area and energy input. Recently, however, an additional explanation has been proposed based on geometric constraints in the placement of geographical ranges within a bounded domain, which cause a mid-domain peak in species richness; the mid-domain effect (MDE). Here, for the first time, we examine the relative importance of area, energy and MDE jointly on species richness patterns. Model selection indicates that the best model incorporates MDE and reef area, but no energy effect; moreover, this best-fit model captures all major features of reef fish and coral species richness patterns. Habitat area is the major environmental factor influencing species richness.

Previous studies show that plant diversity differs between these recent forests and ancient forests that were already forested at the time of first national cadastral surveys, around 1800. Here, we investigated the duration of such agricultural aftereffects. In northeastern France, large areas were deforested during the Roman occupation and thereafter abandoned to forest. In one such forest that was farmed during the period AD 50-250, we show that species richness and plant communities vary according to the intensity of former agriculture. These variations are linked to long-erm changes of chemical and structural soil properties. Hence, we suggest that such effects of past agricultural land use on forest biodiversity may be irreversible on an historical time scale.

DNA barcoding is well established in animals, but there is not yet any universally accepted barcode for plants. Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using >1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a ""DNA barcoding gap"" is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing > 1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes."

Effects of forest conversion on stream beta diversity are much harder to predict, both because empirical studies are few and because competing theories suggest opposite responses. Moreover, almost no data exist for tropical Africa, a region that is paradoxically a hotspot of both current deforestation and freshwater biodiversity. Here, we compared environmental variables, invertebrate community composition, and alpha and beta diversity of forested and deforested (agricultural) streams in and around Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found that forest conversion strongly influenced stream environmental variables and invertebrate community composition, and that agricultural land use reduced stream alpha diversity. However, among-stream beta diversity was greater across the agricultural landscape than inside the forest. Decomposing beta diversity into taxa replacement and richness differences demonstrated that replacement contributed a similar proportion to total beta diversity in both land use classes. Because of this greater beta diversity, the agricultural landscape had similar gamma diversity as the forested landscape despite its lower alpha diversity. We discuss conservation implications of these land use-associated biodiversity changes in a highly diverse yet little-studied deforestation hotspot.	Fugere, V. ; Kasangaki, A. ; Chapman, L.

Given the diversity of ecological, political, and socio-economic systems where offsets may be applied, place-based information is likely to be most useful in designing and implementing offset programs, along with guiding principles that assure best practice. We reviewed the research on biodiversity offsets to explore gaps and needs. While the peer-reviewed literature on offsets is growing rapidly, it is heavily dominated by ecological theory, wetland ecosystems, and U.S.- based research. Given that majority of offset policies and programs are occurring in middle-and low-income countries, the research gaps we identified present a number of risks. They also present an opportunity to create regionally based learning platforms focused on pilot projects and institutional capacity building. Scientific research should diversify, both topically and geographically, in order to support the successful design, implementation, and monitoring of biodiversity offset programs.

Consequently, a number of areas considered important for the conservation of these birds are currently protected by EU legislation. The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), conceived to increase agricultural production, has no restrictions in these protected areas, which creates a conflict between current agricultural policy and legislation on biodiversity conservation. Long-term monitoring of flagship bird species in a Mediterranean protected area shows significant population declines. Similar declines also affect common farmland bird species in others agricultural protected areas, confirming a failure of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. If Europeans want to conserve these landscapes and their biodiversity, the present conservation model should change in farmland areas. Solutions must involve the prohibition of agricultural intensification, and the implementation of sustainable farming practices different from current CAP subsidies.

The development of sustainable, multi-functional agricultural systems involves reconciling the needs of agricultural production with the objectives for environmental protection, including biodiversity conservation. However, the definition of sustainability remains ambiguous and it has proven difficult to identify suitable indicators for monitoring progress towards, and the successful achievement of, sustainability. 2. In this study, we show that a trait-based approach can be used to assess the detrimental impacts of agricultural change to a broad range of taxonomic groupings and derive a standardised index of farmland biodiversity health, built around an objective of achieving stable or increasing populations in all species associated with agricultural landscapes. 3. To demonstrate its application, we assess the health of UK farmland biodiversity relative to this goal. Our results suggest that the populations of two-thirds of 333 plant and animal species assessed are unsustainable under current UK agricultural practices. 4. We then explore the potential benefits of an agri-environment scheme, Entry Level Stewardship (ELS), to farmland biodiversity in the UK under differing levels of risk mitigation delivery. We show that ELS has the potential to make a significant contribution to progress towards sustainability targets but that this potential is severely restricted by current patterns of scheme deployment. 5.Synthesis and applications: We have developed a cross-taxonomic sustainability index which can be used to assess both the current health of farmland biodiversity and the impacts of future agricultural changes relative to quantitative biodiversity targets. Although biodiversity conservation is just one of a number of factors that must be considered when defining sustainability, we believe our cross-taxonomic index has the potential to be a valuable tool for guiding the development of sustainable agricultural systems.

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur. This finding could help to inform the development of the post-2020 biodiversity framework, by highlighting the under-studied regions where biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest. Analysing responses of biodiversity to changes in land use and climate across global ecoregions, the authors identify strong negative responses in both tropical and Mediterranean biomes, driven primarily by low climatic seasonality and the history of human disturbance.

In the past, such activities were funded and managed by the public sector; however, in recent years, public support has declined and this has spawned a growing interest in conservation opportunities that might arise from 'free-market' approaches to sustainable land use and management. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is the key framework for articulating policies and actions on biodiversity; however, progress in developing suitable economic and market incentives for biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use has been slow, with activities such as bioprospecting and ecotourism making some, albeit limited, headway. Given the United Nations Framework for Climate Change or United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) high profile within the public and private sectors, there is some potential for using it to help advance CBD objectives and provide the much-needed economic incentives for conservation, through some of the market-based mechanisms presented under the Kyoto Protocol. Significant potential lies in the fact that many 'natural' forests and certain other ecosystems are both major stores of carbon and areas of valuable biodiversity. Thus, any attempt at conserving these areas has the potential to yield both carbon and biodiversity benefits. So far, however, the conservation of natural forests is not included in the Kyoto Protocol's definition of sinks. Instead the creation of sinks-through the establishment of fast-growing monocultures-may well lead to biodiversity losses, especially if partly degraded lands axe cleared for this purpose. If real progress is to be made, our understanding of the relationship between land use and biodiversity benefits needs to be improved, and more appropriate proxies for biodiversity need to be developed. At the same time, we need to have a clear understanding of the precise nature of the potential synergies and be more able to identify possible jointaction opportunities that exist between the UNFCCC, the CBD and the Convention on Combating Desertification and other international trade and economic agreements.

Water Research	01/01/2012	10.1016/j.watres.2011.10.053	35	Biodiversity recovery measures have often been ignored when dealing with the restoration of degraded aquatic systems. Furthermore, biological valuation methods have been applied only spatially in previous studies, and not jointly on a temporal and spatial scale. The intense monitoring efforts carried out in a highly polluted estuary, in northern Spain (Nervion estuary), allowed for the economic valuation of the costs and the biological valuation of the benefits associated with a 21 years sewage scheme application. The analysis show that the total amount of money invested into the sewage scheme has contributed to the estuary's improvement of both environmental and biological features, as well as to an increase in the uses and services provided by the estuary. However, the inner and outer parts of the estuary showed different responses. An understanding of the costs and trajectories of the environmental recovery of degraded aquatic systems is increasingly necessary to allow policy makers and regulators to formulate robust, cost-efficient and feasible management decisions.

From these predicted distributions, an index of plant species richness was generated for the forest area. The most common predictors for distribution were found to be climatic surfaces incorporating some aspect of seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Although coarse, the index confirmed existing knowledge of areas of high biodiversity within the study area and introduced a new area, the Blackwood Plateau, for consideration as a conservation reserve with high species richness. An additional survey was conducted to sample actual species richness in 11 test sites. When actual richness was regressed against predicted richness, a significant correlation was obtained if both annuals and geophytes were excluded from the analysis. With refinement of the model and further data collection targeted at areas of low effort, the species richness index is proposed as a useful tool for conservation planning.
