This paper is an introduction to and overview of a special issue on groundwater ecology with a focus on biodiversity assessment and conservation. The subterranean environment harbours unique biological communities of remarkable diversity, comprising both microorganisms and micro-, meio- and macrofauna. This biodiversity of ground waters remains poorly known compared to that of freshwater surface habitats. 2. The papers in this special issue summarise the outcome of a large-scale European survey, the PASCALIS project (Protocol for the ASsessment and Conservation of Aquatic Life In the Subsurface), complemented by results from a few other comprehensive studies on groundwater diversity. The papers fall into five broad groups. The first group reviews the biology and ecology of poorly investigated but important subterranean taxa such as Bacteria and Archaea, Oligochaeta and Copepoda. Five papers deal with groundwater biodiversity patterns in the six selected PASCALIS regions. Issues addressed range from broad-scale diversity patterns to partitioning of species richness, cryptic diversity, sampling methodology, and the use of surrogate taxonomic groups for assessing overall diversity. Four papers analyse biodiversity patterns in single European regions, the French Jura, the Walloon region of Belgium, the Lessinian Mountains of Italy and south-western Germany. Two additional papers address the issue of site selection for the conservation and protection of groundwater species, and the fifth group of three papers expands two central PASCALIS themes - sampling adequacy and the role of dispersal. Finally, a concluding synthesis paper summarises advances in understanding groundwater biodiversity patters and conservation and points out important challenges for future research. 3. Collectively, the information presented in this special issue represents the first broad-scale examination of aquatic subterranean diversity based on a rigorously standardised sampling protocol, the first examination of stygofauna patterns in both karstic and non-karstic aquifers, a first step toward integrating traditional and molecular taxonomic studies of groundwater biodiversity, and a start toward elaborating strategies for groundwater reserve selection.

Biomass of heterotrophic bacteria sometimes predominates total heterotrophic biomass in lakes, and organic matter transfer started from heterotrophic bacteria has been intensively studied by numerous researchers all over the world. The roles of planktonic protists, such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates, in microbial loop are to consume bacteria that are too small to serve directly as major prey items for most zooplankters, and to be themselves utilized by the zooplankton. There is a consensus that food linkages between bacteria and protists are substantial in many lakes. In addition, bacterial loss due to viral lysis has also been paid great attention by many researchers since the late 1990. The present review provides the overview on the trend and future stage of microbial loop researches in freshwater systems, with special reference to culture-independent molecular techniques such as PCR cloning and sequencing, fluorescently in situ hybridization or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for phylogenetic analyses on microbial communities. A review on ecology and biodiversity researches on microbial loop in Lake Biwa is also provided."

This can lead to different, sometimes contradictory, outcomes of conservation. We studied local perceptions of ecosystem service flows in the Ranomafana National Park area of Madagascar to examine the local outcomes of conservation. The Ranomafana forest area provides a variety of benefits that contribute considerably to local inhabitants' livelihoods and well-being. Changes in ecosystem service flows alter the provision of many important ecosystem services at the local level, which is likely to affect local livelihoods negatively and increase local vulnerability and inequality. The findings indicate the presence of trade-offs between types of ecosystem services and between different societal goals, namely conservation and development. Benefit trade-offs also occur within and between beneficiary groups and across spatial and temporal scales. Although conservation might prove beneficial for local people in the long run, its immediate local costs are high. The findings reveal the importance of integrating local perceptions of ecosystem services into conservation planning. In addition, there is a need for further negotiations of the trade-offs between ecosystem services, conservation and development in Ranomafana. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1436	WOS:000227647600008	Political incentives for biodiversity conservation	Conservation Biology	01/04/2005	NA	22	There seems to be a worldwide lack of political will for conservation that leads, inevitably, to an undermining of conservation policy. This is a standard complaint but one that has received little academic attention. In an attempt to better understand the gap between conservation policy and practice, we examined conservation policies and practice as they have played out in the Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh, India, over the past two decades. In particular we consider the park's experience within two larger contexts: (1) Himachal's current development orientation, which seeks to transform the state into the electrical powerhouse of the country by building over 300 medium and large power projects and (2) electoral politics that result in politician's support for villagers and others denied access to national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Each of these factors works to undermine state conservation policies. Conservationists need to build political bridges with local communities if they are to use electoral power to work for rather than against conservation. Only such electoral power can be expected to force governments to adopt more cautious policies in advancing a particular development agenda. In the absence of strategic alignments in places such as Himachal Pradesh with strong democratic traditions, one must expect continued political support for potentially destructive megaprojects and an absence of political support for the conservation of biological diversity.

Less attention has been paid to the study of hard bottom organisms settling on both natural and artificial substrates usually present within the basins and often constituting peculiar communities. The ecological role of such communities is remarkable, since they often reach high values of species richness and include bioconstructor organisms able to build true reefs. These reefs can strongly impact the environment, improving biodiversity through the increase of spatial heterogeneity. The present work aims to supplement new faunistic data on five lagoon systems of the south-eastern Italian coast, integrating the still fragmentary knowledge of their macrozoobenthos through the study of hard substrate communities. Sampling was performed on hard substrates colonized by complex benthic communities. The assemblages recorded were then compared in the light of the study sites' main ecological traits. Our data highlighted the occurrence of a rich benthic macrofauna, with 100 taxa found. This markedly increases the value of species richness reported in the literature for the macrozoobenthos of the study sites. In particular, the species list provided for the Ugento Basins was the first ever compiled for this site. In spite of their geographical proximity, the investigated sites, according to their diverse environmental conditions, showed substantial differences as regards their respective macrozoobenthic communities.

To date, actions proposed by the international community to address these problems have largely been conducted in a piecemeal fashion. Conservation biologists advocate for low-intensity management in temperate protected areas to maintain and restore biodiversity. Low-input, high-diversity biomass from such areas has been proposed as a promising alternative bioenergy feedstock. Here, we show that there is a vast unexploited biomass-for-bioenergy potential present in Natura 2000, the European nature conservation network. Spanning 7.5 million hectares (ha), non-forest ecosystems within Natura 2000 have a biomass production of 17.9 teragrams (Tg) of dry matter annually. The conversion of this biomass to bioenergy will not lead to the displacement of food production systems, thereby avoiding 12.5 Tg of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions and circumventing between 1.2 and 2.8 million ha of indirect land-use change. The use of conservation biomass as bioenergy feedstock clearly offers the opportunity to reconcile biodiversity goals and climate-change mitigation.

In response to climatic changes, species around the world have already started to shift their ranges along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. However, it remains unclear whether the areas currently managed for biodiversity protection are optimized for these shifting ranges. Climate velocities represent a method to quantify the rate at which organisms must alter their range to maintain their current climate envelope. Here we use a case study of the Southern Rockies region in the western United States to show how forward and backward climate velocities can be used to quantify potential impacts of climatic changes and delineate abiotic climate refugia. We further illustrate how climate velocities can integrate into a process that simultaneously identifies climate refugia for suites of species while accounting for additional landscape factors contributing to protected area success. These results demonstrate how potential climatic changes may be used to prioritize the efficient selection of climate refugia, potentially aiding multi-target climate adaptation decision-making across broad regions.

Here, we investigated the fungal communities associated with the canopy forming macroalga Sargassum ilicifolium(Turner) C. Argardh (1820) in Singapore. We collected eight S. ilicifolium thalli from each of eight island locations and separated them into three structures-leaves, holdfast and vesicles. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and subsequent analyses revealed weak but significant differences in fungal community composition from different structures. Fungal communities were also significantly different among sampling localities, even over relatively small spatial scales (<= 12 km). Unsurprisingly, all structures from all localities were dominated by unclassified fungi. Our findings demonstrate the potential of marine environments to act as reservoirs of undocumented biodiversity that harbour many novel fungal taxa. These unclassified fungi highlight the need to look beyond terrestrial ecosystems in well-studied regions of the world, and to fully characterize fungal biodiversity in hotspots such as Southeast Asia for better understanding the roles they play in promoting and maintaining life on our planet.

In the present study, infaunal assemblages were examined in the eastern Great Australian Bight (GAB) to evaluate the efficacy of the Benthic Protection Zone of the GAB Marine Park in representing regional biodiversity. Distributional patterns in infauna were further examined in relation to epifaunal species composition and environmental conditions to investigate structural forcing. Grab samples of infauna were collected from the same 65 sites sampled in an earlier survey of epifauna. In total, 240 taxa belonging to 11 phyla were collected. Most taxa were uncommon, with 96% representing less than 2% of the total number of individuals collected and 39% occurring at only one site. Unlike the epifauna, the infauna of the eastern GAB does not appear to be particularly diverse. Sessile filter feeders dominated the infaunal communities of the inner shelf, whereas motile, deposit-feeding organisms dominated the shelf break. As was the case with the epifauna, the highest numbers of taxa and individuals were recorded near the head of the bight and in inner-shelf waters off the western Eyre Peninsula, where productivity is enhanced by upwelling. Cluster analysis identified three community groupings, which were strongly correlated with depth. All three communities and 72% (172) of the 240 taxa collected were represented within the Benthic Protection Zone of the GAB Marine Park, confirming findings from the epifaunal survey that this protected area is well placed to represent the benthic biodiversity of the eastern GAB.

Whereas the term is hard to conceptualize in general, specific links between culture and biodiversity can be explored. In this paper, we focus on land use, which is on one hand culturally coined, and has on the other hand far-reaching impacts on biodiversity. The specific effects of land use on biodiversity depend on its intensity, which can be parameterized in different way, not the least depending on the scale of observation. Based on a short review of different approaches on how to assess land use intensity (LUI), we propose a new conceptual framework reflecting the scaled nature of the linkages between land management and biodiversity. From the plot to the landscape level, different aspects of LUI are becoming relevant, some of which we illustrate with case studies from China, Greece and Switzerland. We conclude on how the framework proposed can further our understanding on the interconnectedness of humans and their environment.

Using choice modeling, the majority of respondents to a survey on pesticide use in the environment are willing to accept an increase in the price of bread if the survival of partridge chicks and the number of wild plants increase. The study identifies the need for further empirical work with respect to methodological validation, price estimation, and the use of survey results in policy analysis. In particular, the environmental effects of pesticide use are complex and, therefore, present difficult challenges when presenting information to lay people. Forty-one percent of respondents changed their responses regarding willingness to pay more for bread when references to pesticide use were introduced in the questionnaire. This indicates that scenarios depicting changes in pesticide use can be difficult to present to lay people in an economically rational and well-defined context. Thus, in the study of valuation related to changes in pesticide use, much attention should be devoted to the design and definition of the context. Furthermore, the effects of providing different background information, e.g., with or without the mention of pesticides, should be tested.

Restoration Ecology	01/01/2010	10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00430.x	15	Revegetation of massively altered landscapes for multiple benefits (including biodiversity and ecological function) has accelerated over the past two decades in southern Australia. However, much of the action has been conducted piecemeal, with little apparent strategy. We consider here replanted woodlands on the floodplain of the Murray River, northern Victoria, Australia. All are small in area (< 18 ha) and recent (< 30 years) and have been planted with appropriate trees and shrubs. We employed a scoring system devised to rapidly measure bird breeding success and linked these results to in-site and landscape variables. Most bird species using the replantings were those that are tolerant of much disturbed landscapes and of open country. Factors related to breeding success were different for each of the six species for which inferences could be made, indicating that it would be difficult to simultaneously plan for all species. Birds characteristic of the major forest floodplain remnants were poorly represented and there was little evidence of their breeding in the replantings. The value of the replanted sites for birds is marginal at present, although it may be that the sites are still too young to have realized their usefulness for species of conservation concern. We believe that most production landscapes in this region have far too little native vegetation to support the many species that are declining, and more strategic planning is necessary to overcome these deficiencies.

Using data for over 10 000 animal species listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, we investigated taxonomic and geographic biodiversity conservation research trends worldwide. We found extreme bias in conservation research effort on threatened vertebrates compared with lesser-studied invertebrates in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats at a global scale. Based on an analysis of common threats affecting vertebrates and invertebrates, we suggest a path forward for narrowing the research gap between threatened vertebrates and invertebrates.

The empirical data was generated from personal interviews and factors influencing the respondents' choice were examined with the aid of multinomial logit model. The results showed that most of the respondents preferred an institution that has less transaction costs. Respondents' choice of biodiversity conservation institution were influenced by factors such as income from farming activities, income from non-timber forest products, and income from non-traditional employment. This study will contribute to the knowledge of natural resource management policy.	Ezebilo, E.

6048	WOS:000086270100005	The biodiversity crisis and adaptation to climate change: A case study from Australia's forests	Environmental Monitoring and Assessment	01/03/2000	NA	6	If current trends continue, human activities will drastically alter most of the planet's remaining natural ecosystems and their composite biota within a few decades. Compounding the impacts on biodiversity from deleterious management practices is climate variability and change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that there is ample evidence to suggest climate change is likely to result in significant impacts on biological diversity. These impacts are likely to be exacerbated by the secondary effects of climate change such as changes in the occurrence of wildfire, insect outbreaks and similar disturbances. Current changes in climate are very different from those of the past due to their rate and magnitude, the direct effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and because highly modified landscapes and an array of threatening processes limit the ability of terrestrial ecosystems and species to respond to changed conditions. One of the primary human adaptation option for conserving biodiversity is considered to be changes in management. The complex and overarching nature of climate change issues emphasises the need for greatly enhanced cooperation between scientists, policy makers, industry and the community to better understand key interaction's and identify options for adaptation. A key challenge is to identify opportunities that facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing technologies and developing policies that enhance the resilience of climate-sensitive sectors. Measures to enhance the resilience of biodiversity must be considered in all of these activities if many ecosystem services essential to humanity are to be sustained. New institutional arrangements appear necessary at the regional and national level to ensure that policy initiatives and research directed at assessing and mitigating the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change are complementary and undertaken strategically and cost-effectively. Policy implementation at the national level to meet responsibilities arising from the UNFCCC (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol) and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity require greater coordination and integration between economic sectors, since many primary drivers of biodiversity loss and vulnerability are influenced at this level. A case study from the Australian continent is used to illustrate several key issues and discuss a basis for reform, including recommendations for facilitating adaptation to climate variability and change.

However, to meet societal demands for predicting changes in ecosystem services, the functional and structural view dominating these two branches of ecology, respectively, must be integrated. Biodiversity-ecosystem function research has addressed this integration for two decades, but full integration that makes predictions relevant to practical problems is still lacking. We argue that full integration requires going, in both branches, deeper by taking into account individual organisms and the evolutionary and physico-chemical principles that drive their behavior. Individual-based models are a major tool for this integration. They have matured by using individual-level mechanism to replace the demographic thinking which dominates classical theoretical ecology. Existing individual-based ecosystem models already have proven useful both for theory and application. Still, next-generation individual-based models will increasingly use standardized and re-usable submodels to represent behaviors and mechanisms such as growth, uptake of nutrients, foraging, and home range behavior. The strategy of pattern-oriented modeling then helps make such ecosystem models structurally realistic by developing theory for individual behaviors just detailed enough to reproduce and explain patterns observed at the system level. Next-generation ecosystem scientists should include the individual-based approach in their toolkit and focus on addressing real systems because theory development and solving applied problems go hand-in-hand in individual-based ecology.

7653	WOS:000221906700008	Topographic controls on the regional-scale biodiversity of the south-western USA	Journal of Biogeography	01/07/2004	NA	94	Aim Topography is a fundamental geophysical observable that contains valuable information about the geodynamic, tectonic and climatic history of a region. Here, we extend the traditional uses of topographic analysis to evaluate the role played by topography in the distribution of regional-scale biodiversity in the south-western USA. An important aspect of our study is its ability to provide a way to quantify characteristics of the topographic fabric and to construct predictive models that can be used to test hypotheses that relate topography and biodiversity. Location South-western USA region of the North American Cordillera. Methods Our approach begins with a quantitative analysis of the topography and the construction of a predicted biodiversity map based on measurable topographic quantities: organization, roughness, slope aspect, grain orientation and mean elevation. We then make a quantitative comparison between the predicted and observed biodiversity, based on the assumption that land-cover diversity is a plausible measure of regional-scale biodiversity. Land-cover information used for this study was collected as part of the U.S.G.S. global land cover characteristics (GLCC) project and is derived from satellite (AVHRR) imagery. Results To a first order, the predicted regional-scale biodiversity based on our topographic model shows a good correlation with the observed biodiversity (as estimated from the land-cover diversity). Our model overestimates the biodiversity in many parts of the Colorado Plateau, Rio Grande Rift, and the low desert regions of the Southern Basin and Range, suggesting that in these provinces a biodiversity estimate based solely on topography is an over-simplification. However, much of the Madrean Archipelago and Sierra Madre provinces, which are centres of high biodiversity in this region, show excellent agreement between the observed and predicted biodiversity. Main conclusions While we acknowledge that many other factors in addition to topography have an important influence on biodiversity (particularly on a local scale), we conclude that topography plays a primary role in the regional to continental-scale biodiversity, particularly in regions characterized by insular mountain fabrics.

Modem assemblages, on the other hand, include many fragile monothalamous (single-chambered) forms and komokiaceans (a superfamily of protist currently placed within the foraminifera) with soft test walls. These groups are poorly known and most of the hundreds of morphospecies recognized in deep-sea samples are undescribed. The relative abundance of robust and fragile taxa varies with water depth and food supply. Calcareous and other hard-shelled species tend to predominate in relatively eutrophic areas, particularly on continental margins, but decrease as a proportion of the 'entire' live fauna (i.e. including soft-shelled species) with increasing water depth, even above the CCD (carbonate compensation depth). Most of the species on which the foraminiferal proxies used in palaeoceanography are based live in these bathyal regions. At abyssal depths, and particularly below the CCD, faunas are largely agglutinated and dominated by monothalamous forms. These assemblages have a much lower fossilization potential than those found on continental margins. In addition to carbonate dissolution, these patterns probably reflect adaptations to increasingly oligotrophic conditions on the ocean floor with increasing depth and distance from land. Bathyal species include herbivores and opportunistic deposit feeders (omnivores) that consume labile organic material, in addition to deep-infaunal deposit feeders, and must contribute significantly to carbon cycling. Many abyssal monothalamous foraminifera, in constrast, accumulate stercomata (waste pellets composed of fine sediment particles) and probably ingest sediment, associated bacteria and more refractory organic matter. Some monothalamous species without stercomata may be bacteriovores. Although they probably process organic carbon at a slower rate than calcareous species. the shear abundance of monothalamous taxa at abyssal depths suggests that they are important in carbon cycling on a global scale. The loss of a substantial proportion of foraminiferal biomass and biodiversity from the fossil record should be considered when using foraminifera to reconstruct palaeoproductivity, for example, by using the Benthic Foraminiferal Accummulation Rate (BFAR). Different dietary preferences among calcareous species have implications for the stable carbon isotope signal preserved in their shells.	Gooday, A.

The Ascomycota was the dominant phylum in both composts (90 % of all sequences recovered) with the thermophilic-rich orders Sordariales and Eurotiales being the most numerous. Molecular studies demonstrated the frequent presence of several thermophilic (Scytalidium thermophilum, Myriococcum thermophilum) and thermotolerant (Pseudallescheria boydii, Corynascus verrucosus and Coprinopsis sp.) fungi in the composts, despite the absence of these species from the culture-based analysis. Conversely, Aspergillus fumigatus and Mycocladus corymbifer, which were the dominant species in cultivation analyses, had very low representation in molecular studies. The results show that the previous picture of the dominant thermophilous fungi in compost communities derived from culture-based analysis has been biased, and that composting environments represent a potentially rich resource of novel fungi.

They have traditionally played an important role in agriculture and horticulture, in the production of firewood, and as windbreaks, boundaries, and screens. Through this investigation of a suburban Satoyama landscape in western Japan, which includes old and new residential areas, public space, farmland, and abandoned land, we aimed to show how isolated trees and hedges are connected with local traditional cultural features, and how this link has impacted their distribution and species composition. By examining land categories, shape patterns, and species compositions of isolated trees and hedges in both traditional and newly developed regions of the study area, we showed how the presence or absence of related traditional cultural features has influenced biodiversity. We further examined the role of traditional management techniques and cultural features in maintaining high numbers of local native species in isolated trees and hedges. Based on our results, we argue that awareness and promotion of the biocultural link in isolated trees and hedges will play an important role in future efforts to preserve the unique local identity and biodiversity of this cultural landscape."

The efficiency of these measures is partly related to our knowledge of their origins and their development, a question rarely addressed. In this paper we examine the development of mires during the 10.000 last years (Holocene) in the eastern Massif Central, France, focusing on the contributions of climate change and human activities. Radiocarbon dates of the basal layers of 63 sites show that many mires formed around 7500 BP. During the Holocene, many mires were formed in the Atlantic period, characterised by warmer and wetter climatic conditions. At shorter time scales of 10(3) - 10(2) years, several other factors are related to peat inception, including topography, geomorphology and superficial geology, vegetation successions and human-induced changes. There is evidence that the building of small dams in headwater streams during the Iron age induced local water logging which then lead to the initiation and growth of mires. The influence of Bronze age communities is further demonstrated by new pollen analysis results. Forest clearing and grazing also favoured soil water logging, enabling peat inception. We consider human societies to be responsible for the formation of some mires. Human activities can be considered to having taken part in the development of the European biodiversity at least during the last 5 millennium.

Pelagic dispersal larvae of marine animals traditionally thought to ensure that populations are widespread, that chances of local extinction are low, and that marine protected areas (MPA) can easily function to replenish both their own populations and those of unprotected areas. Traditionally, dispersal is considered to depend primarily on two variables: pelagic larva duration and far-field currents. These conclusions arise from the 'open population' paradigm and are usually accompanied by a 'simplifying assumption': larvae are distributed passively by far-field currents. Unfortunately, they ignore the complex reality of circulation and hydrological connectivity of reefs, and do not consider newly-demonstrated behavioural capabilities of coral-reef fish larvae. Far-field circulation varies with depth and often excludes water bodies where propagules are released, and this has important implications for predicting trajectories of even passive larvae. However, larvae are not passive: late-stage larvae of coral-reef fishes can swim faster than currents for long periods, can probably detect reefs at some distance, and can actively find them. This behaviour is flexible, which greatly complicates modelling of larval fish trajectories. Populations at ecological (as opposed to evolutionary) scales are probably less open and more subdivided than previously assumed. All this means that dispersal predictions based solely on far-field water circulation are probably wrong. An emerging view of larval-fish dispersal is articulated that takes these new data and perspectives into account. This emerging view shows that re-evaluation of traditional views in several areas is required, including the contribution of larval-fish biology and dispersal to biodiversity patterns, the way reef fishes are managed, and the way in which MPA are thought to operate. At evolutionary and zoogeographic scales, reef-fish populations are best considered to be open.

Some organisms use other species as substrates for attachment, shelter, feeding or parasitism, but there may also be Mutual benefits from the association. Here, we highlight the structural attributes and biotic effects of the habitats that corals, sea pens, sponges and xenophyophores offer other organisms. The environmental setting of the biological structures influences their species composition. The importance of benthic species as substrates seems to increase with depth as the complexity of the surrounding geological substrate and food supply decline. There are marked differences in the degree of mutualistic relationships between habitat-forming taxa. This is especially evident for scleractinian corals, which have high numbers of facultative associates (commensals) and few obligate associates (mutualists), and gorgonians, with their few commensals and many obligate associates. Size, flexibility and architectural complexity of the habitat-forming organism are positively related to species diversity for both sessile and mobile species. This is mainly evident for commensal species sharing a facultative relationship with their host. Habitat complexity is enhanced by the architecture of biological structures, as well as by biological interactions. Colony morphology has a great influence on feeding efficiency for suspension feeders. Suspension feeding, habitat-forming organisms modify the environment to optimize their food uptake. This environmental advantage is also passed on to associated filter-feeding species. These effects are poorly understood but represent key points for understanding ecosystems and biodiversity on continental margins. In this paper we explore the contributions of organisms and the biotic structures they create (rather than physical modifications) to habitat heterogeneity and diversity on the deep continental margins.

Sequencing of cloned 16S rDNA amplicons revealed a diverse community comprised Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria, and Mollicutes in the gut of artificial diet-fed abalone, and majority of Mollicutes, Fusobacteria, Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria, in the gut of starved abalone. Biodiversity of gut bacterial community was rather high in artificial diet fed abalones than in Laminaria fed and starved animals. While, in situ abundance of the community composition determined by FISH revealed that 54% of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained bacteria were hybridized with a probe for Gammaprotcobacteria and 40% of DAPI-stained bacteria appeared to be of the Vibrio group. Alphaproteobacteria, which was frequent in clone libraries, was less abundant in artificial diet fed abalones determined by FISH. Our data show that the Vibrio group can be a dominant component in the gut microflora, of abalone. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The finding of the rare brackish angiosperm Althenia filiformis in the island of Cyprus is interesting since its insertion in the Red Data Book of the Flora of Cyprus is suggested. The following species enriched the flora or fauna lists of the relevant countries: the red alga Sebdenia dichotoma (Greece), the hydrachnid mite Pontarachna adriatica (Slovenia), and the thalassinid Gebiacantha talismani (Turkey). Several alien species were recorded in new Mediterranean localities. The record of the burrowing goby Trypauchen vagina in the North Levantine Sea (Turkish coast), suggests the start of spreading of this Lessepsian immigrant in the Mediterranean Sea. The findings of the following species indicate the extension of their occurrence in the Mediterranean Sea: the foraminifer Amphistegina lobifera (island of Zakynthos, Greece), the medusa Cassiopea andromeda (Syria), the copepod Centropages furcatus (Aegean Sea), the decapod shrimp Melicertus hathor (island of Kastellorizo, Greece), the crab Menoethius monoceros (Gulf of Tunis), the barnacles Balanus trigonus, Megabalanus tintinnabulum, Megabalanus coccopoma and the bivalves Chama asperella, Cucurbitula cymbium (Saronikos Gulf, Greece).

Nevertheless, no comprehensive and systematic region-or nationwide evaluation of the effectiveness of the network has been conducted. We used habitat suitability models and extent of occurrence of 468 species of vertebrates to evaluate the contribution of the Natura 2000 network to biodiversity conservation in Italy. We also estimated the population size of 101 species inside the Natura 2000 network to assess its capacity to maintain or improve the population status of listed species. In general the Italian Natura 2000 did not seem to integrate existing protected areas well. The Natura 2000 network increased from 11% to 20% the area devoted to conservation in Italy and the coverage provided to areas with high biodiversity. Nevertheless, some areas with high numbers of species were devoid of conservation areas, and more than 50% of the highly irreplaceable areas were not considered in the system. Moreover, the Natura 2000 network cannot maintain 44-80% (depending on the taxa considered) of the species in a \""favorable conservation status\"" under World Conservation Union Red List criteria. The Natura 2000 network is probably stronger than the results of our analyses suggest. The system is based on a site-specific expert-based strategy and is driven by direct and detailed knowledge of local diversity. Nevertheless, if Natura 2000 is taken to represent the final point of all the EU conservation policies, it will inevitably fail. Its role in conservation could be enhanced by integrating the Natura 2000 system into a more general strategy that considers natural processes and the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these processes."

We examine optimal conservation decisions given that a biodiversity loss is irreversible and that future use values are uncertain. While species substitutability has been shown to reduce the value of diversity, we show that the flexibility associated with substitutability is a source of value. Marginal species value is decreasing in the number of species, but rising and convex in the value of the marginal species. As we show in the two-species homogenous model, increased volatility raises biodiversity value, and a positive correlation between species values both reduces the value of the pool of species and the value of biodiversity. The role played by the correlation between the value of a species and the value of other species, is reminiscent of the Beta of a financial asset. Just like an asset with a negative Beta derives additional value by providing insurance against fluctuations in the market portfolio, a species whose value tends to move in the opposite direction as the species in use derives additional value from its higher probability to be available for substitution if the value of the species in use diminishes.

Using the value-belief-norm theory, this study identifies the extent to which landowners differ regarding the psychological variables antecedent of a moral obligation to protect local biodiversity after participation in conservation programmes. A survey was carried out among 280 landowners who had to varying degrees participated in either voluntary forest preservation or wetland restoration. The results showed that the landowner groups did not differ in fundamental value structure and ecological worldview. Landowner groups that had participated in the projects tended to be more aware of consequences, ascribing more responsibility to themselves and expressing personal norms obligating them to participate in local biodiversity conservation more than landowners who did not participate. Local biodiversity conservation could benefit from addressing the psychological antecedents of the moral obligation among landowners in parallel with removing structural barriers.

Ecological Engineering	05/01/2018	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.01.006	14	Green infrastructure and in particular green roofs are crucial to meet the challenge of sustainable urbanisation fostered by the current European Research and Innovation agenda. Several documents were issued in the last decades in Europe for regulating the design, construction and up-keep of roof greening. In particular, the actual German guidelines have been widely adopted as a reference basis for green roof design and regulation worldwide, because of its exhaustiveness and proven building- and landscaping tradition. With the aim to assess the effectiveness of green roof guidelines and norms in supporting plant and soil biodiversity in different ecoregions, and particularly of the Mediterranean one, the German guidelines, the Swiss and Italian norms are screened and discussed in this paper. The German guidelines were chosen for their traditional referential role, the Swiss norm for its peculiar biodiversity approach, the Italian one for its application on a territory with remarkably heterogeneous environmental conditions, stretching from Alpine to Mediterranean ecosystems. Even if the three documents at comparison addressed to some extent biodiversity-related matters, none of them deepened the relationship between plant species selection (local ecotypes), growing medium composition (materials, granular size and thickness) and system build-ups (multi-layers and/or single-layer systems). This is a crucial point for countries, like Italy, encompassing very different climatic conditions. It was concluded that at the current knowledge a guideline/norm taking into account the peculiarities of green roof design in the Mediterranean ecoregion has to be widely refined.

Basic and Applied Ecology	06/01/2017	10.1016/j.baae.2017.03.002	5	Biased and subjective choices of metrics to be used in ecological studies could lead researchers to reach misleading conclusions regarding patterns of biodiversity response to human disturbances. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to the choices of variables in the majority of studies published to date. Here, we used the literature concerning land use change effects on dung beetles to assess the extent to which variables commonly employed in ecological studies correspond to those deemed to be most important by researchers of the same studies. Specifically, we examined both biodiversity (response) and environmental (explanatory) metrics from a comprehensive literature review and compared their use with their relative importance, according to a survey of the authors of the studies. Our results highlight marked disparities between researchers opinion expressed in our survey and their choice of variables in published papers. We suggest that these disparities are due to the high costs of sampling and processing some variables, logistical constraints and different perceptions of importance amongst researchers. We highlight the importance of these issues for our understanding of the biodiversity consequences of land use change, and highlight some recommendations for alleviating this issue.

However, debates also exist on whether OF can feed a world with increasing human population. We hypothesized that some improvements on OF may produce adequate crops and reduce environmental pollutions from CF. This paper makes comparative analysis of crop yield, soil organic matter and economic benefits within the practice on Biodiversity Management of Organic Farming (BMOF) at Hongyi Organic Farm (HOF) over eight years and between BMOF and CF. Linking crop production with livestock to maximal uses of by-products from each production and avoid xenobiotic chemicals, we have achieved beneficial improvement in soil properties, effective pest and weed control, and increased crop yields. After eight years experiment, we have obtained a gradual but stable increase in crop yields with a 9.6-fold increase of net income. The net income of HOF was 258,827 dollars and 24,423 dollars in 2014 and 2007 respectively. Thus, BMOF can not only feed more population, but also increase adaptive capacity of agriculture ecosystems and gain much higher economic benefits.

Using the highly biodiverse state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico as a case study, the process by which the application of the science of biodiversity conservation becomes compromised by rural development agendas is illustrated with particular reference to the relationship between the Mexican state, a transnational conservation NGO (WWF) and a community of local conservation NGOs. Semistructured interviewing was the principal research tool used and an actor-network approach informed the analysis. Given the mixed agendas and powerful position of Oaxaca's NGO community it is argued that the extension of the biodiversity agenda into Oaxaca is necessarily a process of negotiation, not of expert driven prescription. Whilst Oaxacan conservation might be improved by strengthening local scientific capacity in the state, the less-than-perfect transmission of biodiversity science to the practice of biodiversity conservation might usefully be reinterpreted as indicative of the successful introduction of local concerns, rather than a failure of conservation.

The reason why only the two specific seasons of winter and summer were chosen is because extreme weather phenomena take place during both seasons that affect the factors of abundance and biodiversity. Of the nine identified taxa, the main contributor to macro-invertebrate abundance in August 2001 was Hediste diversicolor, while Cerastoderma glaucum was the principal one in January 2002. The Spearman coefficient showed a positive correlation of biomass (A') with water temperature (0.39) in January, the concentration of nitrates (0.69), the clay (0.66), and the organic matter of the sediment (0.47-0.53). A positive correlation (Spearman) has also been shown between biodiversity, the percentage of sand in the sediment, and the concentrations of ammonia and nitrates. As species abundance (A) has been positively correlated (Spearman coefficient = 0.21-0.72) with sediment organic matter, vegetation in the lower inter-tidal zone seems to have affected A positively. The analyses of the used indices (A, A', Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, Pielou's evenness, Sorensen similarity) indicated a negative influence on the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates, and a possibly causal relationship between agricultural wastes drained to the estuarine Sperchios system and its sediment quality.

However, we currently lack a clear understanding under which circumstances proposed biodiversity indicators are valid indicators and when they are not. Here we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment by emulating natural disturbances through prescribed burning and gap-cutting. From this experiment data of resident forest birds was used to, (1) identify biodiversity indicators in the middle and northern boreal zone, (2) test the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators and (3) explore the patterns when biodiversity indicator analyses are performed across a wider range of forest types including both restored and unrestored sites. Additionally, to understand the occurrence of species we correlated their occurrence with local habitat structures across different forest types. We found that both the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tri-dactylus) and Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) were important biodiversity indicators for the middle/northern boreal zone. The occurrence of these species can generally be used to identify species rich areas across different forest types. However, the three-toed woodpecker, the best indicator for unrestored forest, lost its indicator value after prescribed burning; in these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the fact that one must be careful about using previously identified biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological restoration.

In its 20-year review report, the National Science Foundation recognizes the achievements of the past and specifies guidance for future development. Among other aspects, research activities of the next decade should concentrate on a new core area: biological diversity, and, to inform environmental policy on the interrelationships and reciprocal impacts of ecological and human systems, LTER is requested \""to partner with social scientists\"" at all existing or newly selected research sites (http://www.nsf.gov/od/Ipa/news/ 02/pr0265.htm). In Europe, LTER activities head in the same direction. To create durable integration of European biodiversity research capacity and to address biodiversity policy needs, long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) sites should serve as real-world laboratories for interdisciplinary and policy relevant research (http://www.lter-europe.ceh.ac.uk and www.alter-net.info). In this paper, we explore how LTER could meet the challenges of the future: the increase of knowledge on issues of biological diversity and of partnership approaches among the natural and social sciences in common research facilities - the LTSER sites. Regarding biological diversity we explore, in particular, the advantages for improving: (1) ecological-economic modelling, a powerful technique for analysing complex human-nature interaction, (2) the design of choice experiments, a rather new evaluation method for assessing the benefits of conservation and (3) the understanding of biodiversity as complex social dilemma. Regarding the issue of research collaboration, we focus on the geographical scale of LTSER sites and, on a more general level, on the demands of research management in terms of project design, common knowledge and organisation of research teams.

Environmental changes, including the introduction of non-indigenous species, increasingly threaten these unique habitats. At the same time, the unique biotic communities subsisting in isolation across the continent are difficult to survey due to logistical constraints, sampling challenges and problems related to the identification of small and cryptic taxa. Baseline biodiversity data from remote Antarctic habitats are still missing for many parts of the continent but are critical to the detection of community changes over time, including newly introduced species. Here we review the potential of standardized (non-specialist) sampling in the field (e.g. from soil, vegetation or water) combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of bulk DNA as a possible solution to overcome some of these problems. In particular, HTS metabarcoding approaches benefit from being able to process many samples in parallel, while workflow and data structure can stay highly uniform. Such approaches have quickly gained recognition and we show that HTS metabarcoding surveys are likely to play an important role in continent-wide biomonitoring of all Antarctic terrestrial habitats.

Yet, in spite of their economic and ecological importance, Opuntia species remain poorly studied and protected in Mexico. Many of the species are sparsely but widely distributed across the landscape and are subject to a variety of human uses, so devising implementable conservation plans for them presents formidable difficulties. Multi-criteria analysis can be used to design a spatially coherent conservation area network while permitting sustainable human usage. Methods and Findings: Species distribution models were created for 60 Opuntia species using MaxEnt. Targets of representation within conservation area networks were assigned at 100% for the geographically rarest species and 10% for the most common ones. Three different conservation plans were developed to represent the species within these networks using total area, shape, and connectivity as relevant criteria. Multi-criteria analysis and a metaheuristic adaptive tabu search algorithm were used to search for optimal solutions. The plans were built on the existing protected areas of Mexico and prioritized additional areas for management for the persistence of Opuntia species. All plans required around one-third of Mexico's total area to be prioritized for attention for Opuntia conservation, underscoring the implausibility of Opuntia conservation through traditional land reservation. Tabu search turned out to be both computationally tractable and easily implementable for search problems of this kind. Conclusions: Opuntia conservation in Mexico require the management of large areas of land for multiple uses. The multi-criteria analyses identified priority areas and organized them in large contiguous blocks that can be effectively managed. A high level of connectivity was established among the prioritized areas resulting in the enhancement of possible modes of plant dispersal as well as only a small number of blocks that would be recommended for conservation management.

To date, it is unknown if these spring and autumn spawning herring constitute genetically distinct units. We assessed levels of genetic divergence between spring and autumn spawning herring in the Baltic Sea using two types of DNA markers, microsatellites and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and compared the results with data for autumn spawning North Sea herring. Temporally replicated analyses reveal clear genetic differences between ecotypes and hence support reproductive isolation. Loci showing non-neutral behaviour, so-called outlier loci, show convergence between autumn spawning herring from demographically disjoint populations, potentially reflecting selective processes associated with autumn spawning ecotypes. The abundance and exploitation of the two ecotypes have varied strongly over space and time in the Baltic Sea, where autumn spawners have faced strong depression for decades. The results therefore have practical implications by highlighting the need for specific management of these co-occurring ecotypes to meet requirements for sustainable exploitation and ensure optimal livelihood for coastal communities.

Species-area relationships (SAR), metapopulation models (MEP) and species distribution models (SDM) are commonly used tools incorporating different ecological processes to explain biodiversity distribution and dynamics. Yet few studies have compared the outcomes of these disparate models and investigated their complementarity. Here we show that the processes underlying SAR (patch area), MEP (patch isolation) and SDM (environmental conditions) models can be compared with a common statistical framework. Our approach allows for species and community-level predictions under current and future landscape scenarios, facilitates multi-model comparison and provides the machinery for integrating multiple mechanisms into one model. We apply this framework to the distribution of eight focal vertebrate species in current and future projected landscapes where 10% of the landscape is lost to land-use change in southwestern, Quebec, Canada. Based on a model selection approach, we found that a model including patch area was the top ranked model for four of our focal species and models including patch isolation and environmental conditions were the top ranked models for two focal species each. Community-level predictions of models based on patch area, patch isolation and environmental conditions for both current and future landscapes showed high spatial overlap, however, patch area models always predicted a reduction of species richness per patch whereas both the patch isolation and environmental conditions models predicted an increase or decrease in species richness per patch following habitat loss and fragmentation. Our comparative tool will allow ecologists and conservation practitioners to relate structural uncertainty to key mechanisms underlying each model. Ultimately, this approach is one step in the direction of deriving robust predictions for the change and loss of biodiversity under global change, which is key for informing conservation plans.

The independent tree management regime generates a tree stock that deviates from the general urban-tree population. This study evaluated species composition, floristic diversity, importance value, and spatial distribution of trees in 102 PHEs (half of the total) occupying 8.31 km(2) (territory land area of 1104 km(2)), assessed their contribution to urban biodiversity, and developed a species selection strategy to enrich urban biodiversity. 48,823 trees belonged to 232 species, 151 genera and 59 families. Natives contributed 69 species and 10,837 trees. Species profile was skewed toward exotic species and trees. The species were divided into six frequency groups. The signature group had 45 species each with >200 trees. The dominant, common and occasional groups had 20, 26 and 48 species, respectively. 59 species in the rare group and 34 in the solitary group denoted changing and diverse species selections, respectively. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) found that species distribution in PHEs was strongly associated with species diversity, estate area and estate age. However, district and region were not correlated with NMDS. Some 98 species were significantly correlated (Spearman) with one or both NMDS axes. Species groups were analyzed to inform a species selection strategy to improve future planting program and enrich urban biodiversity. The methods and findings could be applied to south-China and other cities to rationalize urban-forest programs with the help of objective research data. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The present study identifies the priority of conservation for the medicinal flora of the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region, a Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. A total of 881 medicinal plant species were scored based on key ecological (endemism, threat status) and socioeconomic (use value, mode of harvesting) criteria, and 50 of these are prioritized for conservation; most of these are narrow endemics. Worryingly, all of the 50 prioritized species are currently recognized under different International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources threat categories, are highly prized for their use in traditional medicine in the region and are precious sustainable bioresources for the herbal industry. Most of these prioritized species are being harvested illegally. This integrated ecological and socioeconomic study has immediate implications for evidence-based and target-orientated conservation policy and practice in this Himalayan region.

The Bay area is biogeographically complex due to present temperature regimes as well as historical, climatological, and physiographic changes since the last glaciation. Early investigators recognized the resulting zoological richness, and a significant portion of the collection and taxonomic description of North American marine fauna was centered in the northern Gulf of Maine. A compilation of the results of 19th- and 20th-century research leads to the conclusion that the Cobscook region contains the highest level of marine invertebrate biodiversity in eastern North America north of the tropics. In addition, Cobscook Bay is characterized by noteworthy biological attributes such as the intertidal occurrence of many normally subtidal species and the manifestation of giantism in several populations. These phenomena are summarized briefly as a prelude to a major ecosystem modeling effort.

Focusing on interactions between larval amphibians and trematode parasites, we experimentally contrasted the effects of host richness and species composition to identify the individual and joint contributions of both parameters on the infection levels of three trematode species. By combining experimental approaches with field surveys from 147 ponds, we further evaluated how richness effects differed between randomized and realistic patterns of species loss (i.e. community disassembly). Our results indicated that community-level changes in infection levels were owing to host species composition, rather than richness. However, when composition patterns mirrored empirical observations along a natural assembly gradient, each added host species reduced infection success by 12-55%. No such effects occurred when assemblages were randomized. Mechanistically, these patterns were due to non-random host species assembly/disassembly: while highly competent species predominated in low diversity systems, less susceptible hosts became progressively more common as richness increased. These findings highlight the potential for combining information on host traits and assembly patterns to forecast diversity-mediated changes in multi-host disease systems.	Johnson, Pieter T.

A parallel study on the modern pollen rains in the region shows that the contemporary distribution of species along elevational gradients are distinguished by characteristic pollen assemblages, providing good analogs for the reconstruction of the vegetation history. By analyzing the sediments and pollen recovered from the terraces, a brief history of the region since the late deglaciation is revealed. During the late deglaciation (11-14 ka), the pollen assemblages were particularly rich in Abies, Picea and Betula, indicating a range expansion of the alpine forest during a relatively cold time interval. Meanwhile, co-occurring pollen of Castanopsis, Myrtaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Araliacae, Anarcadiaceae, etc. suggests these tropical/subtropical trees, which are distributed in today's evergreen forests to the south of this region, once extended into these valleys under a wetter climate. However, since the mid-Holocene, the evergreen tropical/subtropical forests have given way to savanna, as revealed from the corresponding pollen assemblages of the second terrace (4-7 ka). The alpine vegetation might have simultaneously contracted to higher elevations under a warmer climate, and subsequently retreated to its present distribution in response to the late-Holocene cooling. Our first glimpse into the Quaternary vegetation history of the TPRR provides new insights into the mountainous biotic response to climatic forcing, and therefore has important implications for diversification in these steep gorges.

Invasive plants have been shown to reduce pollinator visitation to natives and increase pollen quantity limitation. However, visitation and conspecific pollen delivery are the only two components of the pollination process; post-pollination interactions on the stigma (heterospecific pollen [HP] receipt) could intensify pre-pollination responses to invasion. Here, we used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that invasive plants are more detrimental as HP donors than natives ones and that HP donors that are closely related to the recipients have stronger effects on fruit and seed production compared to distantly related ones. Invasive HP donors reduced fruit and seed production of recipients to a greater degree than native ones, and this was more intense for HP donors closely related to natives. Related donors were more detrimental overall.Synthesis. These results suggest that the total effect of invasive plants on native plant reproductive success could be greater than what is inferred from visitation and conspecific pollen transfer alone. Furthermore, these results indicate that invasive species can reduce reproductive success of native species even if pollinator visitation rates remain unaltered. Thus, we highlight the need to evaluate pre- and post-pollination processes in order to fully understand the potential effects of invasive species on the reproductive success and maintenance of native plant populations.

There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km(2) (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920-1975, 1975-1985, 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2013. The grid cells of 1 km(2) have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920-1975, 0.13 during 1975-1985, 0.12 during 1985-1995 and 0.01 during 1995-2005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km(2) (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920's to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km(2) (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.

Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology	6/15/2007	10.1016/j.jembe.2007.01.002	32	Most investigations of biogenic habitat provision consider the promotion of local biodiversity by single species, yet habitat-forming species are often themselves components of diverse assemblages. Increased prevalence of anthropogenic changes to assemblages of habitat-forming species prompts questions about the importance of facilitator biodiversity to associated organisms. We used observational and short-term (30 days) manipulative studies of an intertidal seaweed system to test for the implications of changes in four components of biodiversity (seaweed species richness, functional group richness, species composition, and functional group composition) on associated small mobile invertebrate epifauna. We found that invertebrate epifauna richness and abundance were not influenced by changes in seaweed biodiversity. Invertebrate assemblage structure was in most cases not influenced by changes in seaweed biodiversity; only when algal assemblages were composed of monocultures of species with 'foliose' morphologies did we observe a difference in invertebrate assemblage structure. Correlations between algal functional composition and invertebrate assemblage structure were observed, but there was no correlation between algal species composition and invertebrate assemblage structure. These results suggest that changes in seaweed biodiversity are likely to have implications for invertebrate epifauna only under specific scenarios of algal change.

Telecoupling brings about new challenges and opportunities to biodiversity conservation that are of a larger magnitude and of a faster pace than ever observed before. Our understanding of the dynamics and leverage points of this telecoupled world is however limited. It is thus important to take stock of what we know and what we still need to know to formulate effective biodiversity conservation policies with telecoupling increasing. We identify the challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation brought about by the world's telecoupling in international trade and information by new technologies. Challenges are presented by the high demands for agricultural and wildlife products by high-income and emerging economies, putting pressure on land protection, management and incentive-based conservation interventions. Opportunities are brought about by the strength of telecoupled information flows that can generate strong pressure on multinationals and governments to adopt sustainable practices. Examples of these opportunities are zero-deforestation pledges and the increase in the number of certification schemes in key agricultural commodities. Conservation practitioners need to adopt a global perspective on telecoupling and focus on the new conservation opportunities represented by shaping the social norms of affluent consumers in emerging and high-income economies."

Differences in habitat structure as determined by differences in mussel size structure may affect the diversity of assemblages associated with mussel beds. Previous studies examining the effect of the size of individual mussels in a patch on the diversity of associated macro-faunal assemblages confounded the age of the patch with the size of the mussels. We manipulated the age of mussel patches and the size of the mussels within them to test experimentally whether the size of mussels influenced the structure of associated assemblages. At one of the two locations considered, the structure of macro-faunal assemblages in patches of larger mussels differed significantly from those in patches of the same age composed of smaller mussels. At this location, the size of mussels did not affect species richness but the abundance and proportion of organisms present differed depending on the size of the mussels. Here patches of larger mussels contained greater numbers of Nematodes and Oligochaetes and a lower abundance of taxa, such as faera forsmani and Lepidonotus clava. We also found that invertebrate assemblages in general differed between the two locations. The effect of the size structure of mussels, however, varied spatially demonstrating that the effect of habitat structure on the diversity of associated assemblages is context dependent.	O'Connor, N.

The aims of this study were to analyze the composition and spatio-temporal distribution of the soil microarthropods in this area and the determinant factors. Six different habitats, including two deciduous broad-leaved forests, two coniferous forests, a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest and a subalpine meadow, were selected at elevations of 2659-3845 m. Soil microarthropods were extracted from soil samples collected from each habitat in April, August and November of 2008. The soil-microarthropod communities comprised at least 155 taxa and were dominated by Poduromorpha, Oribatida and Entomobryomorpha. The composition of the soil-microarthropod communities did not vary significantly among the six habitats, but the Acari were more abundant than Collembola in the deciduous broad-leaved forests and subalpine meadow, while the reverse was true in the coniferous forests and conifer-broad leaved mixed forests. Moreover, the diversity and abundance of soil-microarthropod communities varied insignificantly among habitats. However, significant seasonal variation was observed in the composition, abundance and diversity of the soil-microarthropod community in each habitat. The Shannon index was affected by elevation, while the taxonomic richness and Pielou index were sensitive to soil bulk density and C/P ratio, respectively. With regard to taxa, the habitats only had significant influences on the abundances of Poduromorpha, Entomobryomorpha and Mesostigmata, while the seasons had significant effects on the abundances of the all major taxonomic groups. The abundances of Poduromorpha and Entomobryomorpha were mainly affected by the plant species richness, but those of Prostigmata and Mesostigmata were only affected by elevation. The results demonstrate that soil microarthropods in the study area respond more actively to temporal changes than to habitat changes, and the deciduous broad-leaved forests and grassland meadow are more suitable habitats for Acari, while the coniferous-forest habitats are more favorable habitats for Collembola.

Notwithstanding its importance, quantitative information on its spatial structure are still limited, in particular for the Mediterranean Sea. Here, the spatial structure of neuston assemblage of the Western Mediterranean and the Southern Adriatic Seas was analysed, with particular emphasis on the biodiversity pattern in the two study areas. A total of 59 stations were sampled in an oceanographic cruise conducted in May-June 2013. Additional analyses were performed on data on 21 stations sampled in the Southern Adriatic in March 2015 in order to confirm the generality of the patterns observed in the 2013 cruise. Geostatistical analyses indicated that in 2013 in the Southern Adriatic the variation in taxonomic richness, abundance, and ecological diversity of the neuston across stations was characterized by a significant spatial autocorrelation. Conversely, in the Western Mediterranean a negligible spatial structure was observed. In addition, the taxonomic richness and ecological diversity of the neuston resulted significantly higher in Southern Adriatic than in the Western Mediterranean. Data collected in the 2015 cruise confirmed a high taxonomic richness and diversity for the Southern Adriatic; furthermore, a significant spatial autocorrelation was observed for both parameters. The present study represents an original insight into the structure of the neuston community in the Mediterranean Sea, providing strong evidence of the spatial variability of its diversity patterns. The influence of local and large-scale processes is discussed, and the need of more extended investigations is emphasized.

1401	WOS:000477615300015	After the rubber boom: good news and bad news for biodiversity in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China	Regional Environmental Change	08/01/2019	10.1007/s10113-019-01509-4	15	The expansion of rubber plantations in northern Southeast Asia over the last 20years displaced shifting cultivation and tropical forests. In Xishuangbanna, SW China, rubber occupied 22% of the area by 2010, reducing lowland forest to scattered fragments, with severe impacts on plants, animals, and ecosystem services. The rubber price has declined steeply since 2011, but consequences for forest biodiversity have not previously been explored. We use a new approach for vegetation mapping, combining phenological information with object-based classification, to produce land-use maps for 2002, 2010, 2014, and 2018. During 2002-2018, forest cover declined continuously, from 71 to 52% of the land area, while rubber increased from 11 to 24% by 2014, before declining to 21% by 2018. Other farmlands also declined while tea plantations increased. Forest patch number increased 8-fold during 2001-2014, while patch size decreased 10-fold, but these trends were partly reversed after 2014, with the loss of numerous small (<1ha) patches. Most larger (>10ha) patches in 2018 were forest throughout the study period, but many smaller patches are secondary. Currently, 20% of Xishuangbanna is in protected areas. Unprotected forest is disproportionately on steep slopes at high altitudes, while biodiversity is highest in valleys and at low altitudes, where only smaller patches remain, creating challenges for conservation planning. We recommend that all the largest patches are preserved, plus smaller patches selected for their biota, and that forest restoration is used to restore connectivity and buffer small patches of high conservation value.

Presence and activity of different bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling in the biofilm of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) connected to a Koi carp tank were investigated experimentally. For this MBBR system, a nitrogen removing rate of 3.5 g nitrogen per day was found in activity assays, whereas the predicted nitrogen removal rate was calculated to be 58 g nitrogen per day. The presence of ammonium-oxidizing and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the biofilm was demonstrated by situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. A large number of planctomycetes were shown to be present in the biofilm of the reactor, but they did not hybridize to oligonucleotide probes of known genera of anammox bacteria. Molecular 165 rRNA gene analysis of the MBBR biofilm revealed a novel group of planctomycete cells was present in this biofilter, which may explain the difference in experimentally found and calculated nitrogen removal of the system. The novel 16S rRNA gene sequences showed a low similarity to described anammox bacteria. This and other studies may implicate that the anammox reaction can be incorporated in biofilter systems for aquacultural freshwater systems, which makes it possible to remove nitrogen compounds from these systems in a relatively inexpensive and sustainable manner.

However, this region began to change in the early 1970s. The development of industrial harbors, as well as unregulated tourism and urban settlement and pollution caused the loss of natural habitats. In addition, commercial shrimp trawlers began to operate in the adjacent shallow shelf areas. Biodiversity was seriously affected, and local fish stocks have decreased drastically in the last four decades. This article describes a long-term program to protect coastal habitats, recover marine biodiversity and diversify the economic base of fishing communities in order to guarantee fish stocks for future generations, hence preserving the social and cultural identities of these communities. Although it is difficult to change traditional fishing practices, fishing communities may exploit alternate components of the marine biological resources in order to achieve environmental, social and cultural sustainability in the long term.

1961	WOS:A1994PW37600003	BIODIVERSITY IN THE GULF OF GUINEA - AN OVERVIEW	Biodiversity and Conservation	12/01/1994	NA	74	Patterns of species-richness and endemism in the Gulf of Guinea reflect the region's biogeographic history. Bioko is a continental-shelf island that was recently connected to the African mainland, whereas Principe, Sao Tome and Annobon are truly oceanic and have never been connected with each other or with the mainland. As a result, Bioko supports a much more diverse flora and fauna but with relatively low levels of endemism at the species level, whereas the oceanic islands are relatively depauperate because of their isolation but rich in endemic taxa. Species endemism is 0-3% on Bioko for angiosperms, bats, birds, reptiles and amphibians, compared with much higher values on Principe for these same taxa of 8% (plants) to 100% (amphibians), on Sao Tome between 14% (plants) and 100% (amphibians), and on Annobon 0% (bats) to 71% (reptiles). On a global scale, for their size both Principe and Sao Tome support unusually high numbers of single-island endemic species of birds, reptiles and amphibia. For its tiny size, Annobon is also notable for its endemic birds and reptiles. Among terrestrial molluscs the rates of endemism are in general higher than for plants and vertebrates, from ca 50% on Bioko to ca 80% on the oceanic islands. In contrast and as might be expected, only Bioko supports a rich freshwater fish fauna and it contains many endemic taxa, whereas the oceanic islands support only a few salt-tolerant species. The Gulf of Guinea islands are also important for their marine organisms, amongst which coral reef fish and marginellid molluscs show high levels of endemism, though they are not especially species-rich. The Gulf of Guinea islands are of great interest to conservationists and evolutionary biologists. Each island, of greatly differing size and degree of isolation, has acquired its unique sub-set of plants and animals separately from the neighbouring mainland, followed by adaptive radiations in situ. For this reason the conservation value of the archipelago as a whole is greater than the sum of the biodiversity contained in its individual islands. Conservation initiatives in the Gulf of Guinea should therefore ensure that representative terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats and groups of organisms are targeted in a co-ordinated manner among the islands.

Here. the effects of two features of lowland agricultural landscapes on the abundance and diversity of larger moths are contrasted. Although both features bring about positive effects, hedgerow trees have a larger impact than 6 m wide grassy field margins. Whilst AES payments are given to create and maintain grass margins, no financial reward is currently offered for the retention of hedgerow trees. Furthermore, it was only in areas where the amount of land under AES was experimentally increased, by targeting farmers, that the presence of hedgerow trees resulted in a substantially higher abundance (+60%) and diversity(+38%) of moths. Thus, by using larger moths as bio-indicators of landscape-scale quality, it is demonstrated that improvements to the cost-effectiveness of AES could be achieved, firstly, by providing more appropriate financial rewards to farmers for different landscape features, and secondly, through landscape-scale targeting of farmers to encourage participation in AES.

The two primary land-based activities that would help to minimize atmospheric carbon dioxide are carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere and the efficient substitution of biomass fuels and bio-based products for fossil fuels and energy-intensive products. These two activities have very different land requirements and different implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of other ecosystem services. Carbon sequestration in living forests can be pursued on lands with low productivity, i.e. on lands that are least suitable for agriculture or intensive forestry, and are compatible with the preservation of biodiversity over large areas. In contrast, intensive harvest-and-use systems for biomass fuels and products generally need more productive land to be economically viable. Intensive harvest-and-use systems may compete with agriculture or they may shift intensive land uses onto the less productive lands that currently harbor most of the Earth's biodiversity. Win-win solutions for carbon dioxide control and biodiversity are possible, but careful evaluation and planning are needed to avoid practices that reduce biodiversity with little net decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planning is more complex on a politically subdivided Earth where issues of local interest, national sovereignty, and equity come into play. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Relatively little is known, however, of the actual environmental outcomes of this practice, termed 'farmscaping'. We inventoried communities of plant and soil organisms and monitored indicators of ecosystem functions in six distinct habitats of an organic farm in California's Central Valley to better understand the ecological costs and benefits of farmscaping. A riparian corridor, hedgerows, a system of drainage ditches, and tailwater ponds supported different plant life history/functional groups and greater native plant diversity than the two production fields. Differences were less pronounced for belowground organisms, i.e., nematode functional groups, microbial communities (based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and earthworm taxa. Partial ordination analysis showed that environmental variables, rather than spatial location, explained much of the distribution of soil and plant taxa across the farmscape. Riparian and hedgerow habitats with woody vegetation stored 18% of the farmscape's total carbon (C), despite occupying only 6% of the total area. Infiltration rates in the riparian corridor were >230% higher than those observed in the production fields, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution were as much as 65% higher. The tailwater pond reduced total suspended solids in irrigation runoff by 97%. Drainage ditches had the highest N2O-N emissions (mean values of 16.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching (12.1 g m(-2) year(-1) at 75 cm depth). Emissions of N2O-N and leaching of NO3--N were, however, quite low for all the habitats. Non-production habitats increased biodiversity (particularly plants) and specific ecosystem functions (e.g. water regulation and carbon storage). Extrapolating relative tradeoffs to the entire farmscape showed that greater habitat enhancement through farmscaping could increase both biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions of agricultural lands with minor loss of production area.

The results of this sampling activity give a broad overview on the structure and functions of soil biological communities at European arable, grassland and forest sites. Probably more importantly, a set of indicators (i.e., organism groups and measurement endpoints) were identified, fulfilling criteria such as ecological relevance, practicability, or cost efficiency. In this contribution we want to address two issues: firstly, we review current legalization in the European Union and selected member states that relates to monitoring of soil biodiversity as well as selected individual Member States. Secondly, we discuss which legal tools could benefit from applying the set of soil biology indicators identified in the EcoFINDERS project. Since the withdrawal of the proposed Soil Framework Directive in 2014 there is no common legal approach on how to protect soils - and specifically its ecological functions - in Europe. However, assuming that such a general framework will be in shape in the foreseeable future, we will discuss how the new knowledge of soil biodiversity and in particular its monitoring as identified in the EcoFINDERS project would fit into such a potential legal approach.

There are many techniques available to survey terrestrial mammals and in recent years there have been a number of studies comparing the effectiveness of different methods. Most of these studies have not considered complementarity (the degree to which techniques detect unique species) and effectiveness across ecological gradients. In this study we examined three widely used techniques, camera trapping, live trapping and hair detection, for their complementarity across a vegetation and disturbance gradient. Overall, camera trapping detected more species than any other single technique, but live trapping complemented the cameras by consistently detecting unique species. Additionally, technique effectiveness differed between vegetation types; cameras alone were most effective in dry forest systems while cameras combined with live traps were most effective in wetter forest systems. These results suggest that care needs to be taken when sampling across heterogeneous landscapes because relying on one technique alone could result in certain taxa being systematically overlooked, leading to potentially erroneous conclusions.

2709	WOS:000226438600029	Higher taxa as surrogates of plant biodiversity in a megadiverse country	Conservation Biology	02/01/2005	NA	61	"An important question in conservation biology is the extent to which the number of taxonomic supraspecific categories can serve as surrogates of species richness. This issue has been little explored in highly diverse areas. We used 113 floristic inventories from throughout Mexico, a megadiverse country, to evaluate the potential of higher-taxon richness for predicting local species richness of vascular plants. This large biodiversity data set includes the main vegetation types found across the country. In all, 247 families, 2,398 genera, and 11,890 species were used for the analysis, representing 99.6%, 90.2%, and 53.2% of the respective totals recorded in the country. We hypothesized that the number of genera and species would be accurately predicted by the richness of the higher taxon. To avoid getting spurious regressions resulting from the logical increase in lower-taxon richness as a higher taxon becomes richer, we calculated new response variables by subtracting from the number of elements in the lower taxon group the number of those in the higher taxon; these variables were \""excess species\"" (number of species minus number of genera or families) and \""excess genera\"" (number of genera minus number of families). Our results indicate that genera provide very effective surrogates for estimation of local species richness (R-2 = 0.85), whereas families have a more limited potential for this purpose ( R-2 = 0.64). The predictive capacity of the diversity of higher taxon increased when the analyses were constrained to particular vegetation types (maximum R-2 = 0.95 for genera). This surrogate method may be a valuable tool in locating and designing representative systems of protected areas for vascular plant diversity, especially in megadiverse countries, where conservation efforts are hindered by the lack of complete inventories and insufficient resources."

As a national response, Finland has funded a Research Program of Poorly Known and Threatened Forest Species from the year 2003. The program is an essential part of the knowledge base applied in Finnish forest policy. The present paper evaluates the outcomes of the program, covering scientific publication, training, taxonomic coverage, increased knowledge on boreal forest biodiversity and awareness rising. The ongoing program has been funded by 6.5 million Euros to date including 59 projects. The program has produced 19 master's theses and six doctoral theses. Due to their expertise the graduated biologists have been employed in environmental administration or become researchers. The program has produced 163 refereed scientific articles, 104 of which are recognized by the Web of Science; with an average impact factor of 1.81. The results of the program include 15 genera and 348 species new to science, and 60 genera and 1,664 species to Finland's list of known species. Due to new knowledge gathered in the program 3,000-4,000 species could be included in the most recent National Red List assessment. The publishing of identification books on local language has proved as the most effective way of advancing general species knowledge among the public and end-users. The high number of new species to science from a biodiversity-poor boreal country describes the scale of the huge work still be done in describing the global species-level diversity. The program has achieved its goals in many ways, but the program leaves out a large part of the species that do not occur in forest biotopes. Moreover, the funding has decreased through the years despite the international goal of halting the world's biodiversity loss has not been met.

Information regarding the habitat quality and biodiversity of ponds across a range of land uses is vital for the long term conservation and management of ecological resources. In this study we examine the biodiversity and conservation value of macroinvertebrates from 91 lowland ponds across 3 land use types (35 floodplain meadow, 15 arable and 41 urban ponds). A total of 224 macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded across all ponds, with urban ponds and floodplain ponds supporting a greater richness than arable ponds at the landscape scale. However, at the alpha scale, urban ponds supported lower faunal diversity (mean: 22 taxa) than floodplain (mean: 32 taxa) or arable ponds (mean: 30 taxa). Floodplain ponds were found to support taxonomically distinct communities compared to arable and urban ponds. A total of 13 macroinvertebrate taxa with a national conservation designation were recorded across the study area and 12 ponds (11 floodplain and 1 arable pond) supported assemblages of high or very high conservation value. Pond conservation currently relies on the designation of individual ponds based on very high biodiversity or the presence of taxa with specific conservation designations. However, this site specific approach fails to acknowledge the contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at the landscape scale. Ponds are highly appropriate sites outside of protected areas (urban/arable), with which the general public are already familiar, for local and landscape scale conservation of freshwater habitats.

Comprehensive species inventories for many areas currently do not exist, and performing detailed taxonomic surveys is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accordingly, there is a need to develop simple and reliable rapid-assessment techniques for mapping marine biodiversity. One potential approach is to use 'surrogates' that function as proxies for the distribution of other, less easily sampled, 'cryptic' biota. Two potential surrogates for predicting arthropod faunal biodiversity on rock subtidal reefs were investigated in this study: (1) macroalgae, and (2) faunal subsets derived by aggregating the arthropod fauna at higher taxonomic levels. Faunal and macroalgal assemblage composition was only weakly correlated across sites reflecting broad faunal responses to changes in algal structural complexity and/or common environmental gradients. This suggests that algal species composition may not be very informative in mapping patterns of faunal species distribution on reefs. Instead, the best surrogates were related (i.e. nested), subsets of the faunal assemblages such as family-level taxon richness which was found to be a good predictor of arthropod species richness at independent test sites.

In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

To date research has mainly focussed on the protection of trees of economic importance. In most countries the major portion of research costs tend to be borne by the state with governments funding tree health research and the implementation of statutory work (risk assessment, border inspection and surveillance), whilst commercial enterprises cover the costs of ongoing management of established pests and pathogens. The costs of responding to new outbreaks tend to be shared with government or regional authorities organising initial response but owners covering subsequent operational costs without state compensation. However in recent years a number of major epidemics have devastated natural ecosystems and landscapes valued both for timber and for their wider benefits to the general public. Against this background it is helpful to consider more explicitly the consequences of pests and pathogens for the full range of ecosystem services. Biodiversity was originally perceived to be an ecosystem service but is now recognised as fundamental in supporting ecological function. Many ecosystem services are uncosted and enjoyed by a range of stakeholders raising important questions about who is responsible for measures to protect tree health. We present data here on the new outbreaks which have occurred in the UK and, as an example of rapid spread of a disease, on the development of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus in the UK over the last 3 years. These data indicate that tree pests and diseases represent a major contemporary problem to which the ecosystem services concept, and its associated implications for cost sharing, can move forward our approach to prevention and outbreak management and may improve the outcomes of international measures to minimise the man-mediated movement and impacts of pests and pathogens.

However, disturbances such as deforestation and forest degradation threaten the maintenance of these ecosystem services. This study aimed to understand how different disturbance histories affect the forest stand biomass, as well as species and functional diversity, and to what extent these differences can change the relationships between biomass and their drivers. We used data from forests with clear-cut and selectively logged disturbance histories, and from old-growth forests, situated in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Forests with logging disturbances showed significant losses in their aboveground biomass compared to those of old-growth forests (50% loss in selectively logged forests and 80% loss in clear-cut forests). Interestingly, only clear-cut secondary forests showed differences in species and functional diversity, and were dominated by species with acquisitive trait values, commonly found early in succession. Shifts in stand biomass drivers were observed in selectively logged forests. The mass-ratio hypothesis (mainly through the functional trait of maximum height) was the most important biomass driver in clear-cut secondary and old-growth forests, whereas the importance of the niche complementarity hypothesis (through functional richness and dispersion) was higher in selectively logged forests. Our study highlights that disturbance histories can affect forest aboveground biomass and its drivers. Moreover, our results reinforce the need for conservation of intact forests but highlight the importance of including degraded forests in conservation mechanisms based in carbon stocks, as these forests retain high values of species and functional diversities that are crucial to biomass and consequently carbon stock acquisition.

Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2002	NA	75	We test the hypothesis that the biodiversity of the death assemblage of shelled molluscs (gastropods and bivalves) on a single sandflat is representative of the biodiversity of the regional living fauna from the complete spectrum of habitat types, and can therefore be used as a surrogate for the purposes of rapid biodiversity assessment. Two biodiversity indices considered appropriate for such an assessment are average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)), which are, respectively, measures of the degree to which the species are taxonomically related to each other (i.e. the average taxonomic spread), and the degree to which taxa are over or under represented (i.e. the evenness of the distribution across the taxonomic tree). In each case, measured values were compared with the regional living species pool using a randomisation test. Collections and identifications of shells were made by both a non-expert in mollusc taxonomy and by taxonomic experts, the latter using microscopic examination of sediment samples as well as simple surface searches for macro-species. In all studies, Delta(+) for the gastropods in the death assemblage was fully representative of the regional living fauna, but for bivalves it was significantly lower. This is because most of the bivalves were characteristic of the sandflat habitat, which introduced a bias, whereas post-mortem transport of gastropods, characterising exotic habitats, is more random. For gastropods, in all studies but one, Lambda(+) was significantly higher than expected from a random sample of the regional species pool, and for bivalves this was the case for all studies, suggesting the over-representation of some taxa and the under-representation of others. For the total shelled molluscan fauna (gastropods + bivalves) all Delta(+) values were below, and all Lambda(+) values above, expectation. Results obtained by experts and a non-expert in mollusc taxonomy did not differ. In general, death assemblages at a single location are only likely to be representative of a wider region if there is randomisation as a result of post-mortem transport processes.

In this study we explore the influence of roads on the detection probability of medium to large mammals in three vegetation types in the Little Karoo, an arid biodiversity hotspot. We placed cameras in nine 100 m-long transects, running perpendicular from roads within a conservation area. The camera traps were spaced at similar to 25 m intervals, and were active for an average of 88 days each. Detection probabilities relative to distance from roads showed extensive variation between species and habitat types. There was no clear relationship between distance from the road and the detection probability of most species and guilds, although carnivore detection probability declined significantly as distance from roads increased in all vegetation types. Our results suggest that there is considerable inter-specific variation in detection probability that is significantly influenced by camera trap location relative to roads. Therefore studies that seek to maximise the detection rates of particular species or guilds (e.g. carnivores) by placing cameras on prominent roads and trails are unlikely to provide reliable estimates of the relative abundance of the broader range of sympatric species; a trend observed elsewhere but hitherto untested in arid environments. We recommend that future studies employ a mixed design of cameras located on- and off-roads to provide better estimates of biodiversity in general and predators specifically.	Mann, Gareth K.

It is however far from clear which indicators are most appropriate and which are less suitable to summarize trends in biodiversity. One reason for this lack of clarity is that so far the mathematical properties of indicator approaches have had little attention. In this paper, we derive a number of desirable mathematical properties of indicators from economic price-index theory and apply these in the form of tests to W metrics to summarize changes in biodiversity. The metrics species richness, Simpson index, Shannon index, Buckland's modified Shannon index and Sorensen's similarity coefficient violate the monotonicity and proportionality test. The percentage of increasing minus declining species also fails the proportionality test, and in the case where trends are assessed relative to the preceding year, this metric also violates the identity test. Most of these indicators are sensitive to spatial scale. The arithmetic and geometric mean of population indices and the mean abundance have better mathematical performance, but the first two are sensitive to appearing and disappearing species in the system surveyed. The metric mean abundance however can only be applied under particular conditions and has some undesirable properties. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is not sensitive to the base year chosen and has the most favourable mathematical properties of the indicators evaluated. The geometric mean can be straightforwardly extended to take into account unequal values of species if desired. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	van Strien, A. J. ; Soldaat, L.

In our study, we analyse the effects of mitigation measures on the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus), which is directly affected by ongoing land use change and has experienced widespread decline throughout Europe since the 1960s. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit and individual-based ecological model to study the effects of different landscape configurations and compositions on hare population development. As an input, we used two 4 x 4 km large model landscapes, which were generated by a landscape generator based on real field sizes and crop proportions and differed in average field size and crop composition. The crops grown annually are evaluated in terms of forage suitability, breeding suitability and crop richness for the hare. In six mitigation scenarios, we investigated the effects of a 10 % increase in the following measures: (1) mixed silphie, (2) miscanthus, (3) grass-clover ley, (4) alfalfa, (5) set-aside, and (6) general crop richness. All mitigation measures had significant effects on hare population development. Compared to the base scenario, the relative change in hare abundance ranged from a factor of 0.56 in the grass-clover ley scenario to-0.16 in the miscanthus scenario. The mitigation measures of mixed silphie, grass-clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundance in both landscapes ( > 0.3). The results show that both landscape configuration and composition have a significant effect on hare population development, which responds particularly strongly to compositional changes. The increase in crop diversity, e.g., through the cultivation of alternative energy crops such as mixed silphie and grass-clover ley, proves to be beneficial for the brown hare.

Many important problems of classification and phytogeography are connected with them. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate changes in species diversity that took place after mowing of Molinion meadows in Kampinoski National Park was discontinued from 1993 to 2006. Selected Molinion meadows in the park were evaluated in terms of their biological diversity. The data collected represented meadows that were still maintained, as well as meadows that had been abandoned at different times in the past. Biodiversity was evaluated using standard ecological indices and Disturbance Index (Z). In general, the Disturbance Index showed an increase in plant community forms that were abandoned or invaded by alien species. An association that was most like the typical form was seen in well maintained meadows, which suggests that the Disturbance Index continually rises with time after a meadow is abandoned. Ecological strategies and mowing tolerance were determined with the help of the BIOLFLOR database. Numerical classification revealed a highly diverse pattern of variability in the meadows examined. Correlations between ecological indicators and phytocenotic variability in Molinion meadows were also evaluated. Unmanaged meadows were compared to meadows in which meadow conservation management practices were carried out.

Although the protection of biodiversity must be encouraged at different political and spatial levels, a particularly appropriate starting point is the regional level. In order to provide incentives for the relevant political bodies, it is proposed that biodiversity Should be considered in intergovernmental fiscal transfers. It is further suggested that these transfers are measured in line with the results of a biodiversity benchmarking exercise on plant species diversity in the various cantons. This biodiversity benchmarking is based on the species rarefaction method and a fitted power function. For the purpose of illustration, financial transfers are calculated. In this way, a Swiss transfer scheme that is currently under discussion is extended, and a biodiversity index that determines the transfer is introduced as an additional factor. It is shown that financial transfers change according to 1) the weighting of biodiversity and the minimum requirement for eligibility, 2) the size of the cantons, and 3) the influence of other structural particularities relevant to biodiversity. Hence, there is no single optimal solution; the way biodiversity is integrated into fiscal transfer will call for political and scientific deliberation. Such deliberation will also offer opportunities to better understand the role of fiscal policy in conservation policy.

Finding an indicator of species community responses to urbanization is crucial for predicting the consequences of anthropogenic land cover changes. Here, we develop a framework that relies on functional originality. A species is original or equivalently distinct, regarding its traits, if it possesses rare trait values in a community of species. The most original species have the greatest contributions to the trait diversity of that community. We studied plant species originality, in light of observed changes in the level of species richness, along an urbanization gradient in the region of Paris, France. To evaluate potential impacts of urbanization on species assemblages, we simultaneously considered the local community and regional pool as reference scales where to calculate the originality of each species. Then, for each community, we calculated the mean and skewness of local and regional originalities and the ratio of local to regional originality, providing indication on how functionally diverse a community is, how original it is compared to other communities of the region, how evenly distributed species were in the local and regional functional space, and whether regionally-redundant species become original locally due to limiting similarity. The mean functional originality increased with urbanization at both local and regional scales, although this increase vanished in communities with high species richness. The skewness of originalities increased from zero to positive values with species richness in built-up areas and the ratio of local-to-regional originality increasing along the urbanization gradient, except in species-rich communities. Here our results suggest that urban plant communities are composed of both locally and regionally unique urbanophile species, suggesting processes that limit niche overlap to allow species coexistence. In richer communities, these unique species coexist with regionally-redundant species the occurrence of which could be stochastic. Our conceptual framework shows that species originality can inform on environmental processes that influence biodiversity during community assembly. It is flexible enough to be extended to other regions and other contexts complementing diversity metrics in the research of the mechanisms by which human activities impact species assemblages.

Even though GI is inherently a spatial concept, the modern tools for spatial planning have not been recognized, such as in the recent European Environment Agency (EEA) report. We outline a toolbox of methods useful for GI design that explicitly accounts for biodiversity and ES. Data on species occurrence, habitats, and environmental variables are increasingly available via open-access internet platforms. Such data can be synthesized by statistical species distribution modeling, producing maps of biodiversity features. These, together with maps of ES, can form the basis for GI design. We argue that spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) methods are effective tools for GI design, as the overall SCP goal is cost-effective allocation of conservation efforts. Corridors are currently promoted by the EEA as the means for implementing GI design, but they typically target the needs of only a subset of the regional species pool. SCP methods would help to ensure that GI provides a balanced solution for the requirements of many biodiversity features (e.g., species, habitat types) and ES simultaneously in a cost-effective manner. Such tools are necessary to make GI into an operational concept for combating biodiversity loss and promoting ES.

Yet, we know very little about the effect of human impacts on ecological processes derived from trophic interactions. By focusing on biodiversity components of consumer and resource organisms, such as the diversity of phylogenetic lineages and the diversity of traits that influence species interactions, it is possible to simultaneously address the responses to disturbances and their effects on processes. Here, we evaluate the consequences of forest loss on the ecological process of frugivory between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds. For 2 years, and at 14 sites representing a gradient of forest cover in the Cantabrian Range (N Iberian Peninsula), we monitored fruit and bird abundance, and fruit consumption. We compared the response to forest loss of both plants and birds by assessing the changes in phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity in relation to forest cover. We further evaluated how changes in these biodiversity components translate into functional changes by estimating the degree of functional complementarity of plant and bird species. We found different responses of plants and birds to forest loss. The diversity of plant assemblages did not respond to changes in forest cover, whereas bird assemblages markedly lost phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity at high levels of forest loss. Functional complementarity of birds was well predicted by phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity, but functional complementarity of plants depended exclusively on the diversity of traits. Forest loss filtered avian phylogenetic lineages and traits, and influenced how birds contributed to the frugivory process. These results show how the diversity decay of one trophic level may compromise ecological processes derived from trophic interactions. Therefore, we suggest that a multitrophic response-effect framework, which includes measures of functional traits, lineages and species functional contributions across trophic levels, may be required to fully understand the ecological consequences of biodiversity decays.

We employ the following hierarchy: biosphere (10(14) m(2)), ecoregions (10(11)-10(12) m(2)), ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)), ecotopes (10(3)-10(6) m(2)), and individual organisms (10(-4) 10(2) m(2)). Focusing on a case study of West Coast-Western Chats ecoregion (1.7 x 10(11) m(2)) from India, we demonstrate that remotely sensed data permit discrimination of 205 patches of 11 types of sufficiently distinctive ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)) through unsupervised classification by using distribution parameters of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, with a pixel size of 3.24 x 10(6) m(2). At the ecomosaic scale, Indian Remote Sensing LISS-2 satellite data with a pixel size of 10(3) m(2) permit discrimination of approximate to 30 types of sufficiently distinctive ecotopes on the basis of supervised classification, Field investigations of angiosperm species distributions based on quadrats of 1-10(2) m(2) in one particular landscape of 27.5 x 106 m(2) show that the seven ecotope types distinguished in that locality are significantly different from each other in terms of plant species composition, This suggests that we can effectively link localized field investigations of biodiversity with remotely sensed information to permit extrapolations at progressively higher scales.

We used marine turtle nesting data to test the global thresholds and criteria devised for terrestrial systems and adapted to the marine environment. Data were collated for the Melanesian region and used in the first region-wide marine application of the KBA approach. Using the standard criteria, we tested a range of population thresholds to identify and delineate KBAs for five marine turtle species. A series of decision rules were devised during this analysis specific to marine turtles. The study showed that the standard KBA thresholds could be applied to marine turtles in Melanesia, with some modifications. Using the threshold of 10 breeding females, 54 preliminary marine turtle KBAs were identified and delineated for six Melanesian nations. A threshold of 1% of a species genetic stock aggregating at a site was trialled and showed that it made no difference to the identification of KBAs, with the exception of Lepidochelys olivacea. The study demonstrates that this approach to conservation planning, which is most suited to site-associated species, can also be applied to wide-ranging species displaying seasonal congregatory behaviour, such as marine turtles.

I present a conceptual ecological-economic model that combines (i) current results from ecology about the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services with (ii) economic methods to study decision-making under uncertainty. In this framework I (1) determine the insurance value of biodiversity, (2) study the optimal allocation of funds in the trade-off between investing into biodiversity protection and the purchase of financial insurance, and (3) analyze the effect of different institutional regimes in the market for financial insurance on biodiversity protection. I conclude that biodiversity acts as a form of natural insurance for risk-averse ecosystem managers against the over- or under-provision with ecosystem services. Therefore, biodiversity has an insurance value, which is a value component in addition to the usual value arguments, such as direct or indirect use or non-use values. In this respect, biodiversity and financial insurance are substitutes. Hence, the availability, and exact institutional design; of financial insurance influence the level of biodiversity protection.

To understand how and when ecosystem services depend on biodiversity, it is valuable to expand beyond experimental grasslands. We examined whether plant diversity improves the capacity of agroecosystems to sustain multiple ecosystem services-production of wood and forage, and two elements of soil formation-in two types of smallholder fallows in western Kenya. In 18 grazed and 21 improved fallows, we estimated biomass and quantified soil organic carbon, soil base cations, sand content, and soil infiltration capacity. For four ecosystem functions (wood biomass, forage biomass, soil base cations, steady infiltration rates) linked to the focal ecosystem services, we quantified ecosystem service multi-functionality as (1) the proportion of functions above half-maximum, and (2) mean percentage excess above mean function values, and assessed whether plant diversity or environmental favorability better predicted multi-functionality. In grazed fallows, positive effects of plant diversity best explained the proportion above half-maximum and mean percentage excess, the former also declining with grazing intensity. In improved fallows, the proportion above half-maximum was not associated with soil carbon or plant diversity, while soil carbon predicted mean percentage excess better than diversity. Grazed fallows yielded stronger evidence for diversity effects on multi-functionality, while environmental conditions appeared more influential in improved fallows. The contrast in diversity-multi-functionality relationships among fallow types appears related to differences in management and associated factors including disturbance and species composition. Complementary effects of species with contrasting functional traits on different functions and multi-functional species may have contributed to diversity effects in grazed fallows. Biodiversity and environmental favorability may enhance the capacity of smallholder fallows to simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services, yet their effects are likely to vary with fallow management.

Limited knowledge of South African earthworms at the time of the original species description and a misleading specimen illustration led to difficulty in the establishment of its true identity. Thanks to protection of the type material at the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway, this species can be re-described and illustrated, and its lectotype and paralectotype are designated. Types of Microchaetus zulu Michaelsen, 1907, a junior synonym of Tritogenia zuluensis, safely stored for more than a hundred years in the Goteborg Natural History Museum, Sweden, was most helpful in the process of re-description. The significant role played by museums and similar organizations in protecting past and present natural resource treasures for the future, is highlighted. The crucial function of natural history collections in supporting traditional taxonomy, the key to understanding biodiversity, is clearly demonstrated.

7951	WOS:000519115400007	Testing the Effectiveness of DNA Barcoding for Biodiversity Assessment of Moths from Nigeria	Diversity-Basel	02/01/2020	10.3390/d12020085	3	Comprehensive biodiversity assessment of moths in Nigeria rely greatly on accurate species identification. While most of the Nigerian moths are identified effortlessly using their morphological traits, some taxa are morphologically indistinguishable, which makes it difficult for taxon diagnosis. We investigated the efficiency of the DNA barcode, a fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I, as a tool for the identification of Nigerian moths. We barcoded 152 individuals comprising 18 morphospecies collected from one of the remaining and threatened rainforest blocks of Nigeria - the Cross River National Park. Phenetic neighbor-joining tree and phylogenetic Maximum Likelihood approach were employed for the molecular-based species identification. Results showed that DNA barcodes enabled species-level identification of most of the individuals collected from the Park. Additionally, DNA barcoding unraveled the presence of at least six potential new and yet undescribed species-Amnemopsyche sp., Arctia sp., Deinypena sp., Hodebertia sp., Otroeda sp., and Palpita sp. The phylogenetic Maximum Likelihood using the combined dataset of all the newly assembled sequences from Nigeria showed that all species formed unique clades. The phylogenetic analyses provided evidence of population divergence in Euchromia lethe, Nyctemera leuconoe, and Deinypena lacista. This study thus illustrates the efficacy of DNA barcoding for species identification and discovery of potential new species, which demonstrates its relevance in biodiversity documentation of Nigerian moths. Future work should, therefore, extend to the creation of an exhaustive DNA barcode reference library comprising all species of moths from Nigeria to have a comprehensive insight on the diversity of moths in the country. Finally, we propose integrated taxonomic methods that would combine morphological, ecological, and molecular data in the identification and diversity studies of moths in Nigeria.

National implementation of such regimes go through different stages of development, from changes 'on paper' in regulations and guidelines (labelled output), to behavioural changes among target groups (labelled outcome) before responses are seen on the natural environment (labelled impacts). The main purpose of this paper is to apply a quantitative bio-economic model for analysing the potential impacts on Norwegian forestry of two international regimes (the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and an extended version of the Kyoto Protocol), and to discuss the weak and strong points in using this kind of method in policy analysis. Our findings imply that: (i) The CBD regime has rather limited impacts on the forest structure and harvest as long as it is practised with an intensity corresponding to the forest certification schemes used at present in Norway, or with lower intensity. (ii) Practiced with maximum consideration to biodiversity the potential impact of the CBD regime on the forest structure and harvest is strong, and it can reduce the income from timber production by 30% or more compared to present forestry practices. This reduction is highest when forest climate mitigation is given low consideration. (iii) There is a significant mutual relationship between the two regimes analysed, in the meaning that the weaker one of them is implemented, the stronger marginal impact has the other. (iv) Using quantitative bio-economic modelling in policy impact analyses like this contributes to the methodological literature on regime effectiveness, and has several advantages. But due considerations should be given to underlying basic assumptions related to agent behaviour and the ecosystem detail level required.

Amplifying and sequencing marker genes (i.e., metabarcoding) from eDNA can reveal the wide range of taxa present in an ecosystem through analysis of a single water sample. Metabarcoding of eDNA provides higher resolution data than visual surveys, aiding in assessments of ecosystem health. This study conducted eDNA metabarcoding of two molecular markers (cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) to survey eukaryotic diversity across multiple trophic levels in surface water samples collected at three sites along the coral reef tract within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) during four research cruises in 2015. The 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered 785 genera while the COI gene sequences recovered 115 genera, with only 33 genera shared between the two datasets, emphasizing the complementarity of these marker genes. Community composition for both genetic markers clustered by month of sample collection, suggesting that temporal variation has a larger effect on biodiversity than spatial variability in the FKNMS surface waters. Sequences from both marker genes were dominated by copepods, but each marker recovered distinct phytoplankton groups, with 18S rRNA gene sequences dominated by dinoflagellates and COI sequences dominated by coccolithophores. Although eDNA samples were collected from surface waters, many benthic species such as sponges, crustaceans, and corals were identified. These results show the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for cataloging biodiversity to establish an ecosystem baseline against which future samples can be compared in order to monitor community changes.

However, such datasets are often strongly biased due to variation in sampling effort in space and time. These biases may strongly affect diversity estimates and may, thereby, obstruct solid inference on the underlying diversity drivers, as well as mislead conservation prioritization. In recent years, this has resulted in an increased focus on developing methods to correct for sampling bias. In this study, we use sample-size-correcting methods to examine patterns of tropical plant diversity in Ecuador, one of the most species-rich and climatically heterogeneous biodiversity hotspots. Species richness estimates were calculated based on 205,735 georeferenced specimens of 15,788 species using the Margalef diversity index, the Chao estimator, the second-order Jackknife and Bootstrapping resampling methods, and Hill numbers and rarefaction. Species richness was heavily correlated with sampling effort, and only rarefaction was able to remove this effect, and we recommend this method for estimation of species richness with big data collections.

A 2-year farm-scale evaluation of 81 commercial fields in Arizona show that use of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Et) cotton reduced insecticide use, whereas transgenic cotton with Bt protein and herbicide resistance (BtHr) did not affect herbicide use. Transgenic cotton had higher yield than nontransgenic cotton for any given number of insecticide applications. However, nontransgenic, Bt and BtHr cotton had similar yields overall, largely because higher insecticide use with nontransgenic cotton improved control of key pests. Unlike Bt and BtHr cotton, insecticides reduced the diversity of nontarget insects. Several other agronomic and ecological factors also affected biodiversity. Nevertheless, pairwise comparisons of diversity of nontarget insects in cotton fields with diversity in adjacent noncultivated sites revealed similar effects of cultivation of transgenic and nontransgenic cotton on biodiversity. The results indicate that impacts of agricultural intensification can be reduced when replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides by narrow-spectrum Bt crops does not reduce control of pests not affected by Bt crops.

These measures will provide more room for the river and include lowering of the floodplains and excavation of secondary channels. Moreover, these measures provide opportunities for ecological rehabilitation of the floodplains. However, it is expected that floodplain sedimentation and softwood forest development in rehabilitated floodplains will gradually reduce the conveyance capacity and the biodiversity. Therefore, a floodplain management strategy was proposed that would meet both flood protection and nature rehabilitation objectives. This strategy, Cyclic Floodplain Rejuvenation (CFR), aims at mimicking the effects of channel migration by removal of softwood forests, by lowering floodplains or by (re)constructing secondary channels. In this study, the effects of CFR measures on reducing flood levels and enhancing biodiversity along the Waal River were assessed. A one-dimensional hydraulic modelling system was applied together with rule-based models for floodplain vegetation succession and floodplain sedimentation. The model simulations demonstrated that the flood management strategy of Cyclic Floodplain Rejuvenation is able to sustain safe flood levels in the Waal River when about 15% of the total floodplain area is rejuvenated with a return period of 25 to 35 years. The rejuvenation strategy led to a diverse floodplain vegetation distribution that largely complies to the historical reference for the Waal River. Cyclic Floodplain Rejuvenation may be the appropriate answer to solve the dilemma between flood protection and nature rehabilitation in highly regulated rivers.

Penicillia and aspergilli	Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand	09/01/2007	NA	6	In the course of a series of investigations into the biodiversity of indigenous tussock grasslands, penicillia and aspergilli were isolated from soil samples from four locations: Deep Stream and Mt Benger in Otago, Tukino in the central North Island and Cass in Canterbury. Samples were collected in the summers of 2003 and 2005 and, at each locality, were taken from sites under indigenous tussock grassland, under oversown tussock grassland and under pasture cultivated from tussock grassland. Isolations were made on potato-glucose-chlortetracycline agar lates inoculated with soil suspensions. Thirty-six Penicillium species were recovered, all cosmopolitan, and of the 12 most common, 10 species: P. canescens, P. janthinellum, P. janczewskii, P. jensenii, P. lividum, P. loliense, P. melinii, P. miczynskii, P. sclerotiorum and P. simplicissimum were isolated from samples from all four locations but P. montanense and P. novae-zeelandiae were not recovered from Deep Stream or Mt Benger. P. lividum and P. sclerotiorum were recovered mainly from samples from indigenous sites and P. jensenii from oversown or cultivated sites. In other countries, some of these species have been associated with forest-grass land rather than grassland soils and it was thought possible that they were relics associated with pre-human forest vegetation which may have covered the localities. At the subgenus, not species, level, however, the pattern was typical of grassland, not forest, soils, with the subgenus Furcatum dominant. Six of the common species are known to have the potential to produce tremorgens, neurotoxins known to cause incoordination when ingested by mammals but with little investigated effects on invertebrates. Aspergillus cervinus was the only Aspergillus species recovered, only from Tukino and principally from samples from the indigenous sites.	Di Menna, M. E. ; Sayer, S. T. ; Barratt, B. P. ; Bell, N.

Water	12/01/2019	10.3390/w11122551	4	Invasive species are among the top five causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Arundo donax has progressively colonized the riparian zones of Mediterranean rivers with detrimental effects on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, being catalogued as one of the 100 worst invasive species. In order to control this invasive species and restore native riparian vegetation, different methods have been traditionally used, depending on the environmental, economic and social context. Here, the effect of repeated above-ground removal of A. donax on aquatic and terrestrial communities was assessed by testing two different frequencies of mowing (monthly-intensive and quarterly-extensive), combined with the plantation of native species. Specifically, it was evaluated if riparian vegetation, birds and aquatic macroinvertebrates showed significant responses throughout time and between restoration treatments based on 4-year annual biomonitoring data (2015-2018). Changes in taxonomic diversity and ecological quality indices for the different biological communities were tested using mixed-effect models (LMEs). Similarly, comparisons between restored and reference sites were also performed. LMEs were also applied to assess how riparian variables were related to bird and aquatic macroinvertebrate indices. NMDS and MGLM-Mvabund analyses were performed to detect significant post-treatment differences in taxa composition compared to the initial state and reference sites. During this short-term assessment, increases in riparian and aquatic macroinvertebrate richness and quality indices were found, as well as significant decreases in A. donax height, density and cover, without significant differences between restoration treatments. However, differential effects between extensive (positive-neutral effect) and intensive treatments (neutral-negative effect) were detected for bird richness, density and abundance. After three years of restoration actions, restored sites are still far from reference values in terms of taxa composition, species richness and ecological quality, especially for riparian vegetation and birds. Given the high cost and the great efforts required for restoration, extensive repeated mowing, together with native species plantation, are only recommended on river reaches not fully invaded by A. donax and with a high ecological interest.

One factor that may severely alter the ecosystems involved is the introduction and spread of invasive plant species, but the potential distribution and spatial aggregation of suitable habitats for several invaders have not been quantified. The Maxent approach was used to model the potential establishment within the entire mountain range of 11 alien invasive plant species based on stratified sampling and herbaria records and six variables representing climatic extremes, topography, and anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Predictions of habitat suitability were projected to two future change scenarios depicting increasing rates of climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances in 2050 and 2100. Under current climate and disturbance patterns, the models predicted suitable habitats for invasive species establishment to be aggregated in the southwest, east and north-east of the Ukrainian Carpathians, along major rivers and roads at altitudes of up to c. 700 m. Eight per cent of the total area within protected areas was predicted to be potentially susceptible to invasion by at least one species, with 13% of these susceptible habitats being suitable for all 11 species. Under the future change scenarios, suitable habitat ranges increased significantly in the entire study area and within regions of high conservation value. All species were projected to gain suitable habitats at higher altitudes along linear habitats and to potentially expand their ranges laterally from habitats predicted as suitable for current conditions along small rivers and roads. Under the scenario solely of increased average seasonal temperatures, suitable habitats for the establishment of at least one species within protected areas and a proposed ecological network increased by more than 15 percentage points by 2050 and by more than 30 percentage points by 2100 when compared with predictions for current conditions. Similar future patterns were discernible for the aggregation of suitable habitats for all 11 species. Incorporating increases in anthropogenic pressures into climatic-change projections led to a significantly greater projected expansion of suitable habitats for establishment as compared to scenarios considering only climatic changes. As the 11 species have already established viable populations within protected areas, further spread of at least one species is likely if conservation planning is not changed to include the management of invasive species in such areas.

The changes in community characteristics along the gradients of water, heat and altitude, and community edge effects were also considered in this paper. The results showed that the main plants among the three plots were Gramineae, Compositae, Chenopodiaceae and Rosacea, which accounted for 30.0%, 20.0%, 13.3% and 10.0% of the total. There were Artemisia frigid and Carex duriuscula in every plot, which indicated that the three plots were experiencing different degrees of degradation. From the typical steppe to the Mongolica forest-steppe ecotone to the mongolica forest steppe, the cumulative dominance of every type of shrub, sub shrub and perennial grass decreased in order, with a significant difference (p < 0.05). The cumulative dominance of perennial forbs, however, was an increasing trend, and the cumulative dominance of annual herbaceous plants in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone was the highest. The biomass of shrubs, sub shrubs and perennial grasses, and the total biomass of communities, decreased successively among the three plots, and the difference was significant. The biomass of perennial forbs in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone was significantly lower than that observed in the typical steppe and the mongolica forest steppe. The annual herbaceous biomass was low in every plot, but clearly the highest in the mongolica forest-steppe ecotone. The Patrick richness index (P-a), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (II) and Pielou evenness index decreased successively among the three plots.

Consequently, little is currently known about deep-ocean biodiversity in the TER An enriched understanding of biogeographic patterns and the factors that influence them is crucial to the success of efforts to conserve deep-sea communities. The objectives of this research were to provide the first assessment of biodiversity and community composition of bathyal demersal (200 - 3,000 m) fauna across multiple ocean/island archipelagos in the TEP. To better understand biodiversity and its drivers in the region, we tested the hypotheses that biodiversity and faunal assemblage composition vary with location and environmental drivers (e.g., bathymetry, oxygen concentration). Using Deep-Ocean Dropcams, we collected video footage from Clipperton, Galapagos, Revillagigedo, and Malpelo oceanic islands, in depths ranging from 200 to 3,000 m. Taxa richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were calculated for each location. In general, biodiversity values were high closer to the equator and closer to the continent, and low in the locations farther north and farther west. Fish family biodiversity was highest in the Galapagos, followed by Malpelo. In contrast, Clipperton had significantly lower fish family richness compared to all other locations. For invertebrate orders, Revillagigedo was significantly lower in biodiversity compared to the Galapagos and Malpelo. Broad-scale Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) and dissolved oxygen had a positive effect on fish diversity metrics. Both fish and invertebrate assemblages were significantly different among locations. Around each of the island groups are vastly different current patterns, which likely accounts for some of the variation we observed in biodiversity and community composition. Due to the longitudinal East Pacific Rise, which limits population connectivity by creating a spatial barrier to gene flow and dispersal among marine organisms, the TEP is largely isolated from the wider Pacific. The islands and archipelagos likely represent important stepping-stones and corridors for species connectivity across the TEP and the wider Pacific. Therefore, the preservation of these intact ecosystems is crucial for maintaining biodiversity both within the TEP as well as across the wider Pacific region.

We investigated benthic invertebrate communities at 103 sites in braided channels, springs and hillslope streams in the Waimakariri River, New Zealand over 3 months. One hundred taxa were identified, including a number of rare phreatic species. Highest total taxonomic richness occurred in springs (81 taxa), whereas main braids and hillslope streams had fewer taxa (54 and 56, respectively). Spring-fed habitats also had the highest diversity of unique taxa (22), whereas main channels had five and hillslope streams 11 taxa, respectively. Several taxa including the mayfly Deleatidium and orthoclad chironomids were ubiquitous, whereas others such as the flatworm Prorhynchus had restricted habitats. Our results highlight the high spatial heterogeneity of braided river habitats and the importance of springs as centres of invertebrate diversity within braided river catchments.

The study presents collection of up to date publications on biodiversity of Kosovo. Of course, there is still to be investigated particularly in the field of lower plants as well invertebrate fauna species. Beside the small territory of 10,887 km(2), Kosovo is quite rich in both plant and animal biodiversity. Up to date 1800 vascular plant species have been recorded, while expected number is about 2500 species. Number of higher vertebrates is 210, while the invertebrates are not studied with exception of Lepidoptera with about 150 species. There is no Red List of species for Kosovo developed yet, while some short term conservation measures have already taken place.

We tested the hypothesis that recent (between 1990 and 2000) population increases may result in increased threats to biodiversity. GIS data were compiled from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, BirdLife, and the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. Polygon data sets were transformed into rasters with different resolutions from 2.5 to 1 Relationships between species diversity were assessed globally and separately for terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) and for five countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). The number of species within a 20 km-cell varied greatly and reached a maximum of 801. The species-rich cells ( species) were located in a single, almost continuous area across Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and South China. The relationship between vertebrate biodiversity and population density showed that biodiversity increased with HPD until around 10 persons km then decreased until around 200 persons km where it stabilized. This relationship was mediated by land cover and protection status with significant interactions between these variables and with population density. The areas with moderately increasing populations between 1990 and 2000 were those with the highest overall diversity (median 607) whereas those with decreasing populations were those with the lowest diversity (median 479). Our results suggest that population pressure on biodiversity has increased between 1990 and 2000 and this is a relatively widespread phenomenon. The presence of a continuous area of high vertebrate biodiversity calls for international action at a regional scale involving China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Because of this, there is an urgent need to identify the factors leading to collision hotspots and thus implementing effective mitigation measures. By using a stratified random sampling survey, we investigated the fine-scale determinants of roadkill probability in small and medium-sized birds and mammals across a country-size region of Southern Spain, Andalusia (87,000 km(2)), located within a global biodiversity hotspot. During two consecutive seasons, we regularly surveyed 45 road transects of 10 km each and characterized the site-specific attributes of both roadkill and random points, including traffic density, road design (embankments, medians, fences, roadside vegetation and distance to curves), and adjacent landscape matrix. Based on this information, we investigated variation in collision risk according to landscape and road features, and the life history of the affected taxa. Mortality rates of mammals and birds increased with traffic density, and were also significantly affected by the distance to the nearest curve, slope of embankments, height of roadside vegetation, and land use adjacent to roads. Road mortality of both birds and mammals was related to the presence and typology of fences and center medians, so more densely vegetated medians and smaller mesh sizes reduced roadkill probability. Overall, our results indicate that roadkill risk may vary at exceedingly small spatial scales. The information provided by this extensive survey may be used to identify taxa-specific factors associated to roadkill risk and priority points for action. Our findings will therefore be relevant for the design of safer roads for both drivers and wildlife through the application of effective mitigation measures.

3577	WOS:000285326400015	A GIS Based Assessment Tool for Biodiversity Conservation	International Journal of Environmental Research	01/09/2010	NA	11	Infrastructure development often leads to considerable changes in the land use. These changes are major causes of habitat fragmentation and ecosystem loss. Moreover, decrease of the environmental impacts on biodiversity is among the most important objectives of sustainable development. For this purpose, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) along with the other appropriate tools can be applied to identify and predict the magnitude of such problems. Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) as a specific disciplinary tool could be useful to identify the actual impacts on biodiversity within Environmental Impact Assessment. This tool with the assistance of Geographic Information system (GIS) techniques evaluates the data in a comprehensible way. In this paper, a brief case study dealing with the assessment of road alternatives has been carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of BIA. It is found that according to vegetation and wildlife maps, ecosystem loss and fragmentation score of proposed road are more than the existing one. On the basis of the assessment results, the authors also stated that application of BIA in Iran with an exclusive biodiversity is essentially needed.	Monavari, S.

The experimental design consisted of three tiers of small plastic pools arranged at increasing distances from the shore. As a result of community development over six months (January to June 1997) we observed considerable differentiation of physical conditions among replicate habitats at the benign end of the physical gradient, with a concurrent increase in biodiversity (species richness per habitat unit). The most probable explanation for this observed gradient is self-generated habitat heterogeneity that, in turn, promotes biodiversity, likely through species interactions. Using additional analyses, including randomization techniques, we excluded the effects of sample size and external factors as sources for the observed increase in biodiversity in the third tier (furthest from the sea). We interpret this result as evidence for the complex causal relationship among physical stress, habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity.

These alterations threaten the biodiversity of floodplains. While the effects of individual factors on plant species composition and diversity in riparian systems have been frequently studied, it is yet unknown how multiple stressors act in concert and whether the effects remain visible across regions. We chose the floodplains of German Federal Waterways (rivers with a high frequency of shipping traffic) to study the main drivers of plant species composition and biodiversity along heavily modified rivers and aimed to show whether natural differences obscure the effects of human alterations. We recorded the vegetation of river banks, grassland, and alluvial forest fragments in 20 study sites distributed across Germany. Species composition differed from natural floodplain alliances and showed a trend towards terrestrialization and an increase of common species that show no specific preference for floodplain habitats. Despite natural differences such as topography and climate having the strongest influence on plant composition and diversity, the effects of anthropogenic influence (e.g. land use, shipping traffic) remained visible. River construction tended to increase species diversity since the terrestrial species pool is bigger than the one of floodplain specialists. For restoration and ecological river management not only species numbers but their composition and ecological specifics should be considered, and local conditions need to be taken into account.

4710	WOS:000178153900021	Biodiversity, invasion resistance, and marine ecosystem function: Reconciling pattern and process	Ecology	01/09/2002	NA	388	A venerable generalization about community resistance to invasions is that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, a well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, We limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function. In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native-species richness and the number and frequency of normative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 X 25 cm), and an entire site (50 X 50 in). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field. Further synthesis of mechanistic and observational approaches should be encouraged, as this will increase our understanding of the conditions under which diversity does (and does not) play an important role in determining the distribution of invaders in the field.

This paper examines latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richnesses of corals and reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific domain and compares them with gradients predicted by a mid-domain model in which geographic domains are located at random between the latitudinal and longitudinal boundaries-of this region. We test for significant differences between observed and predicted species-richness patterns, and we identify regions that are enriched or depauperate in species, relative to expectation. In addition, we move beyond previous mid-domain analyses by directly comparing observed spatial distributions of geographic ranges with those predicted by a mid-domain model. This comparison indicates precisely how species-richness anomalies are produced by nonrandomness in the distribution of species ranges. For both corals and fishes, large and statistically significant differences exist between observed latitudinal and longitudinal species-richness gradients and those predicted by mid-domain models. Longitudinally, species richness is markedly higher than predicted along the African coast and, to a lesser extent, within the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and it is markedly lower than expected in the eastern Pacific. Latitudinally, species richness becomes increasingly higher than predicted as one moves from the equator to the tropical margins; then it becomes sharply lower than predicted beyond the tropics. Unexpectedly, differences between observed and predicted spatial distributions of range endpoints and midpoints reveal a pattern of nonrandomness that is highly congruent with the hypothesis that gyres in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the IAA forming a porous boundary between them, have a-major influence on Indo-Pacific species-richness patterns. Our analyses indicate that the perspective offered by a focus on explaining nonrandomness in the location of geographic ranges (rather than explaining why species, numbers vary in space) is likely to dramatically alter our assessments of alternative explanations for global species-richness gradients.

A challenge is to understand how those stressors alter the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (B-EF). Amongst the Andean streams of southern Ecuador, we assessed the response of shredder diversity and organic matter breakdown (OMB) to urbanization and identified the urban-associated stressors disrupting the B-EF relationship. A leaf-litter bag experiment during stable flow conditions in 2016 was carried out to quantify total OMB and shredder-mediated OMB, which was estimated to represent the B-EF relationship. We calculated the taxonomic and functional diversity of shredder invertebrates associated with leaf packs. Also, a suite of physicochemical and habitat stressors was measured weekly during the field experiment. Along with the urbanization gradient, both taxonomic and functional diversity of shredders declined while OMB rates decreased. Shredders were absent and their contribution to OMB was null at the most urbanized sites. The B-EF relationship was interrupted through nutrient enrichment, physical habitat homogenization, riparian vegetation disturbance, and leaf-litter availability as a consequence of urbanization. Our results demonstrate how species loss spreads to and affects ecosystem functions in urbanized streams and how environmental stressors alter the B-EF relationship. Better land-use practices are crucial in Andean catchments to guarantee ecosystem services which are the result of successful B-EF relationships.

Using a manipulative experiment, we assessed spatial variation in patch-scale effects of complexity on intertidal biodiversity. Location 27 sites within 14 estuaries/bays distributed globally. Time period 2015-2017. Major taxa studied Functional groups of algae, sessile and mobile invertebrates. Methods Concrete tiles of differing complexity (flat; 2.5-cm or 5-cm complex) were affixed at low-high intertidal elevation on coastal defence structures, and the richness and abundance of the colonizing taxa were quantified after 12 months. Results The patch-scale effects of complexity varied spatially and among functional groups. Complexity had neutral to positive effects on total, invertebrate and algal taxa richness, and invertebrate abundances. However, effects on the abundance of algae ranged from positive to negative, depending on location and functional group. The tidal elevation at which tiles were placed accounted for some variation. The total and invertebrate richness were greater at low or mid than at high intertidal elevations. Latitude was also an important source of spatial variation, with the effects of complexity on total richness and mobile mollusc abundance greatest at lower latitudes, whilst the cover of sessile invertebrates and sessile molluscs responded most strongly to complexity at higher latitudes. Conclusions After 12 months, patch-scale relationships between biodiversity and habitat complexity were not universally positive. Instead, the relationship varied among functional groups and according to local abiotic and biotic conditions. This result challenges the assumption that effects of complexity on biodiversity are universally positive. The variable effect of complexity has ramifications for community and applied ecology, including eco-engineering and restoration that seek to bolster biodiversity through the addition of complexity.

Financial incentives can stimulate local people to participate in biodiversity conservation. A common approach to derive financial compensation is estimating the opportunity costs arising from the adoption of conservation friendly land-use practices. Assuming that farmers are risk averse, we used a decision-making under uncertainty approach to derive financial compensation for local people living in and around Ba Be National Park, Vietnam. Moderately risk-averse farmers need US$ 228 ha(-1) year(-1) financial compensation for the protection of natural forests in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones, whereas the required compensation reaches US$ 334 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone. These compensation payments were derived by comparing financial returns from natural forests with those of the most profitable land use (maize). Compensation amounts decrease to US$ 130 ha-(1) year(-1) in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones and to US$ 218 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone, when considering diversification strategy. Derived financial compensations assume that farms comprise 20% croplands and 80% forest. We conclude that compensation amounts vary with farmers' risk preferences, whether or not diversification strategy is considered, and the level of protection of a given area. 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

By examining specimens of Rosa and Cotoneaster species collected since 1920s in Hengduan Mountains, we analyzed the changes of flowering phenology and flower size in the past century when climate changes were considered to be intensified. We found that flowering phenology of Rosa showed no significant change, but flowering phenology of Cotoneaster was delayed in recent years. Flower size of Rosa species showed a marginally significant decrease over the past century. The results suggested that responses of flowering time to global changes and pollinator mediated selection on floral traits might be more complex than what were expected. Our results indicated that future researches based on investigations of herbarium specimens should be carried out on multiple plant species with different flower structures and life histories to better understand the effects of climate changes on plant traits.

9868	WOS:000463857900005	From climate zone to microhabitat-environmental factors affecting the coastal distribution of tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) in the south-eastern European biodiversity hotspot	Peerj	09/04/2019	10.7717/peerj.6676	4	Background: Tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) are predatory insects usually occurring in various sandy habitats. In south-eastern Europe, especially in lowland areas located close to the sea coast, the diversity of Cicindelidae is one of the highest in the Palaearctic realm. Although previous studies conducted in different areas of the world show that many species are habitat specialists, unfortunately little is known about environmental factors affecting the diversity and distribution of tiger beetles in this region. Material and Methods: Habitat preferences for 12 tiger beetles taxa were analysed. Over 100 samples collected in eight countries located in coastal areas of the Black and Mediterranean Seas were studied, for which climate data, macrohabitat types, and soil parameters (soil humidity, salinity, pH, and structure) were investigated. Results: Most studied Cicindelidae were characterised by narrow or very narrow habitat specialisation and did not co-occur with other ones, including 11 taxa found as habitat specialists occurring only in one or two types of macrohabitat. The most eurythopic species was Calomera littoralis nemoralis which occupied four macrohabitat types. The climatic zone, altitude, and humidity were found as the most important factors in the distribution of the studied tiger beetle species. Salt marshes and sandy sea beaches were noted as the most diverse macrohabitat types. Discussion: Tiger beetle fauna of south-eastern Europe consists mainly of habitat specialists sensitive to environmental changes, which makes these beetles perfect bioindicators. Moreover, as a great number of studied Cicindelidae taxa occur in habitats which are under a significant human impact, we suggest that in the studied area the group can be successfully used as a flagship taxon for insect and nature conservation.

The 75 component species and their populations were highly variably distributed across the site, abundances of the individual dominant animals being significantly patchy and composition of the macrofaunal assemblage being significantly non-uniform. Nevertheless, emergent assemblage attributes exhibited spatial constancy: values of assemblage metrics (faunal abundance, species richness, species density and species diversity) did not differ across the site or across spatial scales, and neither did the patterns of dispersion of species diversity, species richness or observed species density. Distribution of the 2 latter through space was even significantly uniform. Ecological arguments developed for temporal constancy of biodiversity seem broadly applicable to the spatial dimension at Knysna, suggesting that although apparently paradoxical, it may be the varying assemblage composition that permits this spatial stability. There is no evidence, however, that the Knysna seagrass macrobenthos is a competitively-structured assemblage with rigid niche-partitioning, a condition suggested to be necessary for temporal constancy; rather, it is more likely to be open, non-equilibrium and below carrying capacity.

The model was based on a comparison between the set of data associated with each species (i.e., depth range, associated substrates and geographic distribution within the Gulf) and the environmental conditions prevailing in the Gulf (i.e., depth and substrate), using a georeferenced grid of 2 x 2 nautical miles. Results are presented as predictive biodiversity distribution maps for the major molluscan groups. Putative biodiversity ranges were defined using a percentage accumulative system with 20% classes. As expected, the highest biodiversity occurs along the coastline and around the islands. A south-north biodiversity gradient is observed, although it is less evident between the southern and central Gulf.

Surrogates are used in marine conservation planning when there is limited information on the distribution of biodiversity, and representation of species and assemblage diversity are conservation goals. With prior confirmation of their relationship to spatial variation in biodiversity, habitat classification schemes are a potentially useful surrogate. 2. Polychaetes can comprise over one-third of species of benthic infaunal assemblages, they are the most frequent and abundant marine metazoans in benthic environments, and they are a reliable surrogate for other macrobenthic taxa. 3. It was tested whether polychaete biodiversity differed among six estuarine habitat classes defined for conservation planning in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, New South Wales, Australia: subtidal sand, mud, muddy sand, and seagrass beds comprising Posidonia australis, Zostera capricorni and mixed Posidonia/Zostera. Polychaetes were sampled from replicate sites in each habitat and differences among habitat classes in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure were examined. Several environmental variables, known to be important determinants of polychaete distribution, were also quantified at each site. 4. Ninety-five species of polychaetes (belonging to 35 families) were identified. Species richness and abundance did not differ among the habitat classes. Polychaete assemblages of subtidal sand differed from assemblages in both mud and muddy sand, however, assemblages in all other habitats were not different. A combination of some of the measured environmental variables (distance to the estuary entrance, depth, sediment grain size) was a more important determinant of assemblage variation than the habitat classes. 5. Using these predictors, an alternative habitat classification scheme to the scheme currently utilized in marine park planning is proposed. 6. This study demonstrates the critical importance of testing assumptions about surrogacy and an approach for refining surrogates. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Native species vanished or decreased, while invasive species such as Pleopis polyphemoides, Acartia tonsa, M. leidyi and the larvae of Balanus sp., plus Hediste diversicolor dominated the zooplankton. It could be stated that the increasing amount of nutrients since the early 1980s led to a decrease of endemic species and smoothed the way for opportunistic invader species, which outcompeted and depleted the endemic species in their turn. However, the major changes in the zooplankton community and possibly the blooming of M. leidyi during 2001-2002 were triggered by changing weather patterns, when a period with heavy rain at the end of the 1990s was followed by a prolonged drought (2001-2002). It is not clear to what extent M. leidyi was responsible for the disappearance of endemic Copepoda and Cladocera species such as Eurytemora grimmi, Limnocalanus grimaldii, Cercopagis pengoi, and Polyphemus exiguous, because the mesozooplantic invader species seemed to be more successful competitors than the endemic Caspian Sea fauna. Compared with other areas of the Caspian Sea, the development of the M. leidyi stock was moderate in the area under investigation. Mnemiopsis leidyi numbers and biomass increased from the beginning of sampling in 2001 to about 600n.m(-3) and 40-60g wet weightm(-3) until 2003. Since then the stock oscillated in this range until 2010.

1424	WOS:000165680300022	Remote sensing of vegetation, plant species richness, and regional biodiversity hotspots	Ecological Applications	12/01/2000	NA	234	Understanding mesoscale patterns of ecosystem properties is important if we are to effectively monitor ecosystem change due to land use and climate change. Remote sensing provides the best tool for looking at large areas of the earth's surface to analyze, map, and monitor ecosystem patterns and processes. Patterns of vegetation and variation in biodiversity are important ecosystem properties, with strong relationships to important ecosystem functions. Species richness is the most widely used measure of biodiversity, and mapping patterns of species richness within a landscape can provide a basis for future monitoring and an ecological basis for land management and conservation decisions. This study presents (1) a map of the vegetation of the Hood River region of the Central Canadian Arctic derived from a supervised classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, (2) estimations and maps of regional variation in plant species richness, and (3) a comparison of three species richness estimation techniques. The three vascular species richness estimates are derived from measures of variation in normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI), abundance of mapped vegetation types weighted by relative potential species richness, and a multiple regression of both these variables for 17 sampling sites of 500 pixels each. Ground-based measures of species richness range from 69 to 109 vascular plant species per 0.5-km(2) sample area. Variation in NDVI is positively correlated with measured species richness and a weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types. Multiple regression indicates that variation in NDVI and weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types explain 79% of the variance in ground-based measures of species richness. Three methods for remotely estimating species richness agree to within +/- 15 species over 60% of the area and +/- 30 species over 93% of the area.

There are several methods to assess on-farm biodiversity but it may be difficult to select the most appropriate method for a farmer's individual circumstances. This study aims to evaluate the usability and usefulness of four biodiversity assessment methods that are available to farmers in Switzerland. All four methods were applied to five case study farms, which were ranked according to the results. None of the methods were able to provide an exact statement on the current biodiversity status of the farms, but each method could provide an indication, or approximation, of one or more aspects of biodiversity. However, the results also showed that it is possible to generate different statements on the state of biodiversity on the same farms by using different biodiversity assessment methods. All methods showed strengths and weaknesses so, when choosing a method, the purpose of the biodiversity assessment should be kept in the foreground and the limitations of the chosen methods should be considered when interpreting the outcomes.

2585	WOS:000085366700013	Response time of wetland biodiversity to road construction on adjacent lands	Conservation Biology	02/01/2000	NA	171	Road construction may result in significant loss of biodiversity at both local and regional scales due to restricted movement between populations, increased mortality, habitat fragmentation and edge effects, invasion by exotic species, or increased human access to wildlife habitats, all of which are expected to increase local extinction rates or decrease local recolonization rates. Species loss is unlikely to occur immediately, however. Rather, populations of susceptible species are expected to decline gradually after road construction, with local extinction occurring sometime later. We document lags in wetland biodiversity loss in response to road construction by fitting regression models that express species richness of different taxa (birds, mammals, plants, and herptiles) as a function of both current and historical road densities on adjacent lands. The proportion of variation in herptile and bird richness explained by road densities increased significantly when past densities were substituted for more current densities in multiple regression models. Moreover, for vascular plants, birds, and herptiles, there were significant negative effects of historical road densities when the most current densities were controlled statistically. Our results provide evidence that the full effects of road construction on wetland biodiversity may be undetectable in some taxa for decades. Such lags in response to changes in anthropogenic stress have important implications for land-use planning and environmental impact assessment.

It is thus likely that termites play a major beneficial role through promotion of essential ecological processes in agroecosystems in conflict with their well-established role as pests. This paper reviews the impacts of land clearing and preparation, cropping systems and management practices on termite diversity and activity. Current knowledge of the role of termites in agroecosystem function is discussed with reference to soil processes, vegetation cover, atmospheric gas exchanges and agricultural intensification.

This new view is consistent with the ecosystem approach to natural resource management advocated by the Convention on Biological Diversity. This collection of six papers, which is based on a Workshop held in June-July 2004, brings together studies of biodiversity impacts of traditional agroforestry practices from Central and South America, Africa and Asia. The contributions highlight the considerable potential of traditional agroforestry practices to support biodiversity conservation, but also show their limits. These include the importance of sufficient areas of natural habitat and of appropriate hunting regulations for maintaining high levels of biodiversity in agroforestry land use mosaics, as well as the critical role of markets for tree products and of a favourable policy environment for agroforestry land uses. In combination the case studies suggest that maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems, along with a pragmatic, undogmatic view on natural resource management, will provide the widest range of options for adapting to changing land use conditions.

3343	WOS:000247775600009	A new method to estimate species and biodiversity intactness using empirically derived reference conditions	Biological Conservation	07/01/2007	10.1016/j.biocon.2007.02.024	46	Critical to the conservation of biodiversity is knowledge of status and trends of species. To that end, monitoring programmes have reported on the state of biodiversity using reference conditions as comparison. Little consensus exists on how reference conditions are defined and how such information is used to index intactness. Most use protected areas or an arbitrary year as reference. This is problematic since protected areas are often spatially biased, while arbitrarily defined reference years are often not sufficiently distant in time. We propose an alternative that relies on empirical estimates of reference conditions. Statistical ranges of reference are estimated and compared with observed occurrence and abundance to index status of individual species. When averaged among species, overall iritactness is estimated. We demonstrate the approach using 202-winter mammal tracking sites from the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Intactness was estimated at 89 out of 100 with the southern boreal having lowest intactness and greatest human footprint. We suggest empirical predictions of reference conditions be used as baselines for comparing changes in the state of species and biodiversity. Reporting can occur at any spatial (e.g., ecosystem) or hierarchical (e.g., species, guilds, taxonomic group, or overall biodiversity) scale and is easily interpreted (scaled from 0-degraded to 100-intact). When used in a long-term monitoring framework, statistical trends in biodiversity intactness can be estimated, individual status of species assessed, and relevant policy evaluated.

While control reduced swine abundance, remaining animals consistently rooted the 49 studied sites in both middle-dry season (MDS) and late-dry season (LDS) each year. At each study site, we measured rooting with sub-meter accuracy. Neither total nor proportional area rooted differed in either season, across study years, or among plant community types: herbaceous seepage slopes, wet pine savannas, wet grasslands. The proportion of sites with damage during MDS was at least 25 % less than pre-control baseline. During LDS, the proportion of sites with damage increased over years but remained below the initial 2 years' MDS results. Fresh rooting frequency (rooting < 1 week-old) across sites dropped precipitously from baseline and remained low for MDS. Fresh rooting frequency among sites during LDS was lower than MDS for all but year two of the study. Canopied habitat < 50 m from a study site almost guaranteed rooting at the site each observation period. We propose actions for protecting wetlands, integrating swine control into other compatible land use practices, and improving swine control efficacy. While we measured damage amounts at each site very accurately, our approach of also considering frequency of rooting and frequency of fresh rooting across sites offers low-labor means to broadly assess swine damage and control efficacy at large geographic scales because in-field measurements of damage amounts are not needed.

The small and isolated populations of many island taxa, and their evolution in the absence of humans and their introduced taxa, mean that they are particularly vulnerable to human activities. Consequently, even the most degraded islands are a focus for restoration, eradication, and monitoring programmes to protect the remaining endemic and/or relict populations. Here, we build a framework that incorporates an assessment of the degree of change from multiple baseline reference periods using long-term ecological data. The use of multiple reference points may provide information on both the variability of natural systems and responses to successive waves of cultural transformation of island ecosystems, involving, for example, the alteration of fire and grazing regimes and the introduction of non-native species. We provide exemplification of how such approaches can provide valuable information for biodiversity conservation managers of island ecosystems.

Nonetheless, because traits such as geographic range size, trophic status or phenotypic characteristics are tied to a particular species, mechanistic effects driving broad diversity patterns should manifest across numerous dimensions of biodiversity. We develop an approach of stronger inference based on numerous dimensions of biodiversity and apply it to evaluate one such putative mechanism: the mid-domain effect (MDE). Species composition of 10,000-km(2) grid cells was determined by overlaying geographic range maps of 133 noctilionoid bat taxa. We determined empirical diversity gradients in the Neotropics by calculating species richness and three indices each of phylogenetic, functional and phenetic diversity for each grid cell. We also created 1,000 simulated gradients of each examined metric of biodiversity based on a MDE model to estimate patterns expected if species distributions were randomly placed within the Neotropics. For each simulation run, we regressed the observed gradient onto the MDE-expected gradient. If a MDE drives empirical gradients, then coefficients of determination from such an analysis should be high, the intercept no different from zero and the slope no different than unity. Species richness gradients predicted by the MDE fit empirical patterns. The MDE produced strong spatially structured gradients of taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional and phenetic diversity. Nonetheless, expected values generated from the MDE for most dimensions of biodiversity exhibited poor fit to most empirical patterns. The MDE cannot account for most empirical patterns of biodiversity. Fuller understanding of latitudinal gradients will come from simultaneous examination of relative effects of random, environmental and historical mechanisms to better understand distribution and abundance of the current biota.

4287	WOS:000449129700032	A method for identifying suitable biodiversity offset sites and its application to reclamation of coastal wetlands in China	Biological Conservation	11/01/2018	10.1016/j.biocon.2018.09.030	6	We explored the potential for biodiversity offsetting to be applied in regions with considerable development pressure. We developed a method to identify suitable locations for restoration offsets and applied this to coastal reclamation in the Yellow River Delta region of China, an internationally important area for migratory birds, but in which 44% of wetlands have been reclaimed. We evaluated the suitability of sites for offsetting based on their ecological similarity to development sites, the potential of biota to migrate between sites and socio-economic criteria. We predicted that 60-100% of all reclamation in the Yellow River Delta between 1980 and 2015 could be theoretically offset provided no constraints were placed on where offsetting occurs within the region. However, where potential offset sites were constrained to areas with high suitability only 8-15% of historic coastal reclamation could be offset. Spatial options for offsetting also declined where time lags before restoration were longer. Our results indicated that strict in-kind biodiversity offsetting becomes increasingly challenging in highly modified landscapes because of a lack of spatial options for offsets and a tendency for potential offset sites to be dissimilar to the habitat that originally occurred on developed sites in these landscapes. Policies that seek to enable development within highly modified landscapes by providing flexibility for offsetting in space and time risk providing offsets that are ecologically dissimilar from development sites and have limited capacity for biota to migrate to or from them. Our methodology can be used as a planning tool to indicate the level of development within a landscape or region beyond which no net loss is unlikely to be feasible.

An important challenge is to predict how marine sediment communities and benthic biogeochemical cycling will be affected by these ongoing changes. To this end, it is of paramount importance to first better understand the natural variability in coastal benthic biogeochemical cycling and how this is influenced by local environmental conditions and faunal biodiversity. Here, we studied sedimentary biogeochemical cycling at ten coastal stations in the Southern North Sea on a monthly basis from February to October 2011. We explored the spatio-temporal variability in oxygen consumption, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and alkalinity fluxes, and estimated rates of nitrification and denitrification from a mass budget. In a next step, we statistically modeled their relation with environmental variables and structural and functional macrobenthic community characteristics. Our results show that the cohesive, muddy sediments were poor in functional macrobenthic diversity and displayed intermediate oxygen consumption rates, but the highest ammonium effluxes. These muddy sites also showed an elevated alkalinity release from the sediment, which can be explained by the elevated rate of anaerobic processes taking place. Fine sandy sediments were rich in functional macrobenthic diversity and had the maximum oxygen consumption and estimated denitrification rates. Permeable sediments were also poor in macrobenthic functional diversity and showed the lowest oxygen consumption rates and only small fluxes of ammonium and alkalinity. Macrobenthic functional biodiversity as estimated from bioturbation potential appeared a better variable than macrobenthic density in explaining oxygen consumption, ammonium and alkalinity fluxes, and estimated denitrification. However, this importance of functional biodiversity was manifested particularly in fine sandy sediments, to a lesser account in permeable sediments, but not in muddy sediments. The strong relationship between macrobenthic functional biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling in fine sandy sediments implies that a future loss of macrobenthic functional diversity will have important repercussions for benthic ecosystem functioning.

Microorganisms specialized in leading anaerobic reductive dechlorination (RD) processes, including Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc), are able to reduce chlorinated compounds to harmless products or to less toxic forms. Here we report the first detailed study dealing with the RD potential of heavy polluted marine sediment by evaluating the biodegradation kinetics together with the composition, dynamics and activity of indigenous microbial population. A microcosm study was conducted under strictly anaerobic conditions on marine sediment collected near the marine coast of Sarno river mouth, one of the most polluted river in Europe. Tetrachloroethene (PCE), used as model pollutant, was completely converted to ethene within 150 days at reductive dechlorination rate equal to 0.016 meq L-1 d(-1). Consecutive spikes of PCE allowed increasing the degradation kinetics up to 0.1 meq L-1 d(-1) within 20 days. Strictly anaerobiosis and repeated spikes of PCE stimulated the growth of indigenous Dhc cells (growth yield of similar to 7.0E + 07 Dhc cells per mu M Cl-1 released). Dhc strains carrying the reductive dehalogenase genes tceA and vcrA were detected in the original marine sediment and their number increased during the treatment as demonstrated by the high level of tceA expression at the end of the microcosm study (2.41E + 05 tceA gene transcripts g(-1)). Notably, the structure of the microbial communities was fully described by Catalysed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) as wells as the dynamics of the dechlorinating bacteria during the microcosms operation. Interestingly, a direct role of Dhc cells was ascertained suggesting the existence of strains adapted at salinity conditions. Additionally, non-Dhc Chloroflexi were retrieved in the original sediment and were kept stable over time suggesting their likely flanking role of the RD process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the most comprehensive multi-taxa comparison to date, we modelled variation in national population indices of 501 mammal, bird, aphid, butterfly and moth species as a function of annual variation in weather variables, which through time allowed us to identify a component of species' population growth that can be associated with post-1970s climate trends. We found evidence that these climate trends have significantly affected population trends of 15.8% of species, including eight with extreme (> 30% decline per decade) negative trends consistent with detrimental impacts of climate change. The modelled effect of climate change could explain 48% of the significant across-species population decline in moths and 63% of the population increase in winged aphids. The other taxa did not have significant across-species population trends or consistent climate change responses. Population declines in species of conservation concern were linked to both climatic and non-climatic factors respectively accounting for 42 and 58% of the decline. Evident differential impacts of climate change between trophic levels may signal the potential for future ecosystem disruption. Climate change has therefore already driven large-scale population changes of some species, had significant impacts on the overall abundance of some key invertebrate groups and may already have altered biological communities and ecosystems in Great Britain.

Similarly, the supply of multiple ecosystem services from agro-ecosystems and trade-offs between services remains under-researched. As a consequence, it is unclear how and to what extent agriculture can deliver on environmental sustainability, whilst maintaining current levels of profitability. One of the main barriers to implementation of environmental management practices is the perception by the farming industry that environmental gains come at a cost and impact negatively on profitability. Therefore, we need to demonstrate that inclusion of all the natural resources on farm in farm system design and management offers flexibility for the farm system and insures improved sustainability and greater resilience. In this study, an ecosystem approach was paired with a new generation farm system optimisation model and the inclusion of natural resources beyond land, especially biodiversity, to explore farm system design, and report on ecosystem services beyond food and fibre from different parts of the farm. The approach was tested on a sheep and beef farm in Waikato, New Zealand to explore the added benefits of replanting fragile parts of the farm land-scape for soil and biodiversity enhancement on reduced emissions to air and water, and trade-offs between different services and farm profitability. The approach showed that it is possible to define and include ecological boundaries within which resources can be managed to deliver multiple benefits ranging from increased per hectare profitability to decreased environmental footprints. This is a feature analytical farm system frameworks will require in the future. The research also highlighted the importance of developing our understanding of the relationship between the condition and function of indigenous biodiversity fragments and adjacent pastoral ecosystems and their contribution to economic, environmental, cultural and social outcomes on and beyond the farm.

6414	WOS:000431987600022	Origin context of trait data matters for predictions of community performance in a grassland biodiversity experiment	Ecology	05/01/2018	NA	5	Plant functional traits may explain the positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning, but species-level trait variation in response to growth conditions is often ignored in trait-based predictions of community performance. In a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), we measured traits on plants grown as solitary individuals, in monocultures or in mixtures. We calculated two measures of community-level trait composition, i.e., community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy; FD) based on different contexts in which traits were measured (trait origins). CWM and FD values of the different measurement origins were then compared regarding their power to predict community biomass production and biodiversity effects quantified with the additive partitioning method. Irrespective of trait origin, models combining CWM and FD values as predictors best explained community biomass and biodiversity effects. CWM values based on monoculture, mixture-mean or community-specific trait data were similarly powerful predictors, but predictions became worse when trait values originated from solitary-grown individuals. FD values based on monoculture traits were the best predictors of community biomass and net biodiversity effects, while FD values based on community-specific traits were the best predictors for complementarity and selection effects. Traits chosen as best CWM predictors were not strongly affected by trait origin but traits chosen as best FD predictors varied strongly dependent on trait origin and altered the predictability of community performance. We conclude that by adjusting their functional traits to species richness and even specific community compositions, plants can change community-level trait compositions, thereby also changing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Incorporation of these plastic trait adjustments of plants in trait-based ecology can improve its predictive power in explaining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.

River embankments have become one of the most extensive and widespread secondary habitats in former floodplains. We compared the diversity patterns of secondary dry and wet grasslands on river embankments with those of seminatural dry and wet grasslands in a Hungarian agricultural landscape using the following community descriptors: (a) species diversity, (b) phylogenetic diversity and (c) functional diversity. We also performed trait-based analyses to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by these secondary grasslands. Both grassland types of the embankments showed significantly higher Shannon diversity compared with their seminatural counterparts. The cover of generalist species (i.e., cosmopolitan species, weeds and nonindigenous plant species) was high in the secondary grasslands. We found significant differences in phylogenetic diversity between the secondary and seminatural grasslands: secondary grasslands showed significantly lower mean nearest taxon distances than the seminatural grasslands. Functional diversity did not differ between the secondary and seminatural grasslands according to the Rao's quadratic entropy. However, we found higher community-weighted means of specific leaf area, plant height and flowering period in the secondary grasslands, which are related to important ecosystem services (via biomass production and pollination). Well-planned management actions and restoration activities could help further improve the ecological function and conservation value of secondary grasslands on river embankments, contributing to the maintenance of species diversity and sustaining the functionality of ecosystems in agricultural landscapes.

Here we examine tropical vs. temperate diversities from the Neogene to Recent using the within-habitat diversity measure Fisher's alpha of Cenozoic benthic foraminifera from the temperate Central Atlantic Coastal Plain and the tropical Central American Isthmus. During the Neogene, the mean value of alpha at temperate latitudes increased 1.4 times or 40%, whereas in the tropics it increased 2.1 times or 106%. Thus, while both areas exhibit an increase of diversity with time, past differences in the rate of increase have generated a more pronounced gradient today (164%) than existed in the Miocene (80%). These data disagree with the suggestion that the world reached an equilibrium number of species during the Paleozoic and demonstrate the need to consider both temperate and tropical components in global diversity assessments.

By combining a conceptual model and empirical data, we test whether eDNA transported in river networks can be used as an integrative way to assess eukaryotic biodiversity for broad spatial scales and across the land-water interface. Using an eDNA metabarcode approach, we detect 296 families of eukaryotes, spanning 19 phyla across the catchment of a river. We show for a subset of these families that eDNA samples overcome spatial autocorrelation biases associated with the classical community assessments by integrating biodiversity information over space. In addition, we demonstrate that many terrestrial species are detected; thus suggesting eDNA in river water also incorporates biodiversity information across terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Environmental DNA transported in river networks offers a novel and spatially integrated way to assess the total biodiversity for whole landscapes and will transform biodiversity data acquisition in ecology.

Moreover, we still lack comprehensive understanding of the extent to which biodiversity loss in Mediterranean wetlands will accelerate change in ecosystem processes. Here, we evaluate how changes in biodiversity can alter the ecosystem of the Camargue (southern France). We collected data on species presence/absence, trends and abundance over a 40-year period by combining observations from the scholarly literature with insights derived from expert knowledge. In total, we gathered more than 1500 estimates of presence/absence, over 1400 estimates of species abundance, and about 1400 estimates of species trends for eight taxonomic groups, i.e. amphibians, reptiles, breeding birds, fish, mammals, dragonflies (odonates), orthopterans and vascular plants. Furthermore, we used information on recently arrived species and invasive species to identify compositional changes across multiple taxa. Complementing targeted literature searches with expert knowledge allowed filling important gaps regarding the status and trends of biodiversity in the Camargue. Species trend data revealed sharp population declines in amphibians, odonates and orthopterans, while birds and plants experienced an average increase in abundance between the 1970s and the 2010s. The general increasing trends of novel and invasive species is suggested as an explanation for the changing abundance of birds and plants. While the observed declines in certain taxa reflect the relative failure of the protection measures established in the Camargue, the increasing exposure to novel and invasive species reveal major changes in the community structure of the different taxonomic groups. This study is the first attempt to assess changes in biodiversity in the Camargue using an expert knowledge approach, and can help manage the uncertainties and complexities associated with rapid social-ecological change in other Mediterranean wetlands.

Public green spaces, namely parks, gardens and green squares, are often too numerous to allow a detailed study of all of them. Due to their high heterogeneity, a random selection or a stratification based on few features would have consequences on the statistical validity of subsequent biodiversity analysis. Therefore, we aim to present a sampling methodology for public urban green spaces for the selection of a representative group that reflects the diversity of the original population. First, the stratification is based on a selection of variables considered relevant for biodiversity research and easy to evaluate, specifically total area, vegetation cover, impermeable area, water, age, dominant function and space character. Then, a clustering method, through finite mixture modelling, is applied to generate groups of similar green spaces. The application of the proposed sampling methodology was tested in Porto, Portugal. It aims to facilitate site selection for urban biodiversity surveys, in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of biodiversity analysis in public green spaces. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Ecology and Evolution	12/01/2012	10.1002/ece3.415	7	Producer diversity is frequently assumed to be detrimental to herbivores, because less edible taxa are more likely to dominate diverse communities. Many producers are, however, complementary in their resource use, and primary production is often positively related to producer diversity. We performed an experiment with microalgae and a generalist herbivore to explore the hypothesis that such positive effects are transferred up the food chain and are functionally comparable to effects of enrichment with a limiting resource. In both absence and presence of grazers, primary production was positively affected by both light supply and producer diversity. Survival, reproduction, and biomass of herbivores were also positively affected by light supply and producer diversity, with both factors contributing equally to grazer performance. We conclude that producer diversity can indeed have similar positive effects on secondary production as enrichment with a limiting resource and discuss conditions under which such positive effects are likely to dominate over negative ones.

Buffer strips are often applied as a mitigation measure against diffuse pollution in agricultural areas, primarily because they may retain nutrients and in this way help protect the aquatic environment. Additionally, they can improve biodiversity in an otherwise homogenous landscape and may therefore have a value in their own right. In the present study, we characterized the structural and functional features of the vegetation in Danish buffer strips using a nationwide dataset to explore: i) their floristic quality in terms of species diversity and conservation value and ii) based on their functional characteristics, their potential to retain nutrients. Moreover, we analyzed how the structural and functional characteristics varied along gradients in the environmental features of the catchment. We found that the floristic quality of the buffer vegetation was generally low, exhibiting an average of only 3.3% of the number of species of conservation interest. Instead, Danish buffer strips were dominated by widespread and productive species that are tolerant of anthropogenic impacts in the catchment. The abundance of highly productive plant species was positively related to high intensity land use, whereas the abundance of stress-tolerant plant species was positively related to low intensity land use. The high productivity of the buffer strips implies a large bio-storage potential, and these areas might therefore offer an opportunity to remove nutrients by harvesting the plant biomass. We discuss how Danish buffer strips could be exploited via appropriate management (e.g. harvesting) to maximize nutrient retention and at the same time improve floristic quality.

Using an eDNA metabarcoding approach, we regularly sampled 500 km of a large river (Rhone River). Comparisons with long-term electrofishing surveys demonstrated the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to qualitatively and quantitatively reveal fish assemblage structures (relative species abundance) but eDNA integrated a larger space than the classical sampling location. Combination of a literature review and field data showed that eDNA behaves in the water column like fine particulate organic matter. Its detection distance varied from a few km in a small stream to more than 100 km in a large river. To our knowledge, our results are the first demonstration of the capacity of eDNA metabarcoding to describe longitudinal fish assemblage patterns in a large river, and metabarcoding appears to be a reliable, cost-effective method for future monitoring.

The data on bird observations were collected on 530 sampled sites (150 in cultivated, 150 in forest, 150 in grassland and 80 in urban and peri-urban environments). In each environment, sampled sites with values of bird species richness in the upper than third quartile were classified as high species richness spots (HSRS), while sites with lower bird species richness were classified as non-HSRS (binary classification system). Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were applied using HSRS or non-HSRS as binomial response variable and bird species occurrence was used as the predictor variable. All selected models showed \""fair\"" or \""good\"" capacities to predict the avian hotspots, using only few common birds (4-6) species. However, bird species selected as predictors were different on each environment. In more natural environments (grassland, forest), specialist species were selected, while in most disturbed environments (cultivated and urban) both generalist and specialist species were selected. The results are in agreement with other studies which show how homogenization of bird communities is strongly correlated to landscape disturbance. The findings supports the hypothesis that indicators have to incorporate both specialists and generalist's species simultaneously. Furthermore, the groups of birds selected as surrogates are easy to detect and this makes it possible to involve citizen-science programmes in obtain data. This approach can be a cheap and efficient and can help to significantly speed up the process of assessing ecosystems that might be under threat. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."

Habitat conversion, resulting from anthropogenic land use, is considered the dominant factor driving terrestrial biodiversity loss. Hence, adequate modelling of land use impacts on biodiversity in decision-support tools, like life cycle assessment (LCA), is a priority. State-of-the-art life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) characterisation models for land use impacts on biodiversity translate natural habitat transformation and occupation into biodiversity impacts. However, the currently available models predominantly focus on total habitat loss and ignore the spatial configuration of the landscape. That is, habitat fragmentation effects are ignored in current LCIAs with the exception of one recently developed method. Methods Here, we review how habitat fragmentation may affect biodiversity. In addition, we investigate how land use impacts on biodiversity are currently modelled in LCIA and how missing fragmentation impacts can influence the LCIA model results. Finally, we discuss fragmentation literature to evaluate possible methods to include habitat fragmentation into advanced characterisation models. Results and discussion We found support in available ecological literature for the notion that habitat fragmentation is a relevant factor when assessing biodiversity loss. Moreover, there are models that capture fragmentation effects on biodiversity that have the potential to be incorporated into current LCIA characterisation models. Conclusions and recommendations To enhance the credibility of LCA biodiversity assessments, we suggest that available fragmentation models are adapted, expanded and subsequently incorporated into advanced LCIA characterisation models and promote further efforts to capture the remaining fragmentation effects in LCIA characterisation models.

CASE STUDY: BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN JIU VALLEY NATIONAL PARK	Environmental Engineering and Management Journal	01/06/2014	NA	1	During the last decades, the biodiversity conservation became a constant concern for the specialists in environmental resource management by increasing the awareness of the complexity, fragility and inestimable value of our planet. Nowadays, this issue should be an ethical duty for all the 7.2 billion inhabitants of the planet. The biodiversity conservation should be approached as a multidisciplinary research field, developed in response to the actual world crisis. In this multidisciplinary field the IT has currently a crucial role, since the accountable management of environmental resources is difficult to be conceived without the help of this tool. The paper is part of this multidisciplinary approach, since it discusses the use of an integrated IT project for generating practical measures towards the biodiversity conservation of the Jiu Valley National Park (JVNP).

However, the magnitude of impact may vary across habitats, highlighting the need to account for spatial heterogeneity in assessment studies. Here we compare invertebrate community structure in three habitats (littoral, sublittoral, and profundal) of boreal lakes that suffer recurring blooms of a regionally expanding, nuisance flagellate, Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyta), with the assemblage structure in lakes were no blooms occur. We contrast community structure over a 6-year period using univariate metrics (total abundance, community evenness, species richness, and Simpson diversity) and multivariate community similarity to infer habitat-specific associations of local (alpha) diversity. We also calculated indices of multivariate dispersion to infer associations with beta diversity; i.e., whether or not habitats in bloom lakes show faunal homogenisation. Results show that the magnitude of assemblage alteration in bloom relative to bloom-free lakes varied with habitat and increased from the littoral to the profundal habitats. Littoral assemblages in bloom and bloom-free lakes shared similar alpha (taxon richness, evenness and Simpson diversity) and beta diversity characteristics, despite differing in multivariate community similarity. By contrast, alteration of assemblage structure was most severe in the profundal and manifested in reduced diversity and faunal homogenisation (i.e. decreased beta diversity) in bloom relative to bloom-free lakes. This was due to numerical dominance of the predatory phantom midge, Chaoborus flavicans, in the profundal of bloom lakes. Not only do the results highlight that spatial heterogeneity should be accounted for to assess the potential broader impact of nuisance species on biodiversity within lakes; more generally, the dominance of a single species suggests a reduced overall resilience of bloom lakes, making them more susceptible to environmental perturbation.

Bootstrap estimates of total catch per unit effort increased from 6.96 and 10.8 ind. m(-1) h(-1) in 1967 and 1970, respectively, to 583.98 ind. m(-1) h(-1) in 1998. Gear effects and an effect of gear over time accounted for 47.1% and 20% of species variability. Further significant factors were time of day and habitat, while season was not significant. A total of 43 species was collected. Including supplementary species information, a grand total of 46 species was found associated with the Great Meteor Seamount. Diversity was higher in 1967 and 1970 (Shannon's diversity: H'=2.5 and 1.6) than in 1998 (H'=0.9). Species-environment relationships are discussed in terms of a sound-scattering layer-interception hypothesis, i.e. utilisation of prey from a diurnally moving sound-scattering layer for the bentho-pelagic community. This is probably augmented by concentration effects in a circular current around the seamount (Taylor-column). Long-term changes are discussed with respect to a decrease in biodiversity due to considerable increases in Macroramphosus scolopax and Capros aper. In 1998, the increase of abundance of Trachurus picturatus and the respective decreases for genuine benthic species were likely to have been caused by a change of gear.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences	01/09/2003	10.1139/F03-081	58	The utility of single taxonomic groups as indicators of biodiversity variation in other taxa has recently gained increasing attention, but such studies on stream organisms are lacking. We studied the diversity patterns of mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and chironomid midges across 110 headwater streams in Finland. Specifically, we examined if species richness and assemblage composition showed similar variation among the taxonomic groups across environmental gradients and if a single taxon could be used as a predictor of diversity in the other groups. Species richness and composition in different taxa exhibited slightly different relationships to environmental gradients, leading to low degrees of concordance. The diversity of mayflies and chironomids showed strongest relationships with stream acidity and water colour, whereas stoneflies and caddisflies exhibited more complex correlations with geographical location and local environmental variables. The overall assemblage composition, however, exhibited significant among-taxon congruence, as shown by Mantel tests. However, even these correlations remained rather low, thus limiting their potential for conservation purposes. Overall, our results do not support the use of single taxonomic groups as indicators of insect biodiversity in headwater stream ecosystems. Alternative approaches for lotic biodiversity assessment (e.g., morphospecies, higher-taxon richness, and environmental diversity) should thus be examined in future studies.

We considered two simple proxies of species persistence: a time series of point-count data to calculate abundance and a time series of presence-absence data to calculate permanence (a measure of consistent occupancy over time). Using two 10-year intervals of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we compared the performance of each measure at predicting persistence 18 years later. For nonrare species, abundance and permanence predicted persistence similarly well. We performed complementarity-based reserve selections with data on species abundance and permanence (from 1970 to 1979) and then evaluated the effectiveness of the reserve networks at maintaining species populations and efficiency in land use (data from 1997 to 2006). Abundance proved a better predictor of future local persistence than permanence, which justifies the relatively larger financial and temporal costs of collecting a time series of point-count data to estimate abundance. If future extinction events were used as a measure of reserve-network effectiveness, the performance of abundance and permanence did not differ markedly. Nevertheless, when future abundance, which is a more sensitive measure of network effectiveness, was used, abundance was significantly better than permanence at selecting longer-term, high-quality, species-specific habitat but required larger reserves to do so.

Birds	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2001	NA	39	Human activities, such as logging, modify the forest structure and the microenvironments of the original Nothofagus forests. The aims of this work were to evaluate changes in the diversity and relative abundance of birds and to analyze their trophic relationships with insect and plant communities along the Nothofagus pumilio forest management cycle. Data was collected using a point sampling method along transects located in different forest structures during the summer season, by direct (sight) and indirect (hearing) recognition following sunrise. Bird diversity and abundance significantly varied along the forest management cycle. Seven new species appeared after harvest, but the total number did not vary by the end of the forest management cycle, and there was no significant loss of species. Bird abundance was directly related to the insect abundance and plant biomass. Relationship between groups (lower plants, monocotyledons and dicotyledonous) is also discussed. Major studies in bird ecology are necessary to develop new silvicultural alternatives based on the more sensitive species to harvest. Forest management strategies and mitigation alternatives must be incorporated into forest planning in order to maintain the original structure of bird communities and the equilibrium with other forest species.

The biodiverse tropics offer a challenge of an altogether different magnitude for hyperspatial and hyperspectral remote sensing. This paper examines issues related to hyperspatial and hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery, which constitutes one of the most potentially powerful yet underutilized sources of for tropical research on biodiversity. Hyperspatial data with their increased pixel resolution are possibly best suited at facilitating the accurate location of features such as tree canopies, but less suited to the identification of aspects such as species identity, particularly when spatial resolution becomes too fine and pixels are smaller than the size of the object (e.g., tree canopy) being identified. Hyperspectral data on the other hand, with their high spectral resolution, can be used to record information pertaining to a range of critical plant properties related to species identity, and can be very effective used for discriminating tree species in tropical forests, despite the greater complexity of such environments. There remains a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost, data coverage, and security restrictions. Stimulating discussion on the applications of this powerful, but underutilized tool by ecologists, is the first step in promoting a more extensive use of such data for ecological studies in tropical biodiversity rich areas.

Perceptions of actors in REDD+ implementation processes can guide the design of appropriate policies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Peru with actors in REDD+ working groups at the national and subnational level (n = 50) to explore how they relate REDD+ implementation to biodiversity conservation and other policy issues, and to identify the aspects of biodiversity they regard as especially important (biodiversity conservation values). Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis; actors' statements were summarised into nine policy issue categories. Issues raised often were related to governance, socioeconomic aspects and land management in REDD+ implementation (47 % of the statements). Biodiversity issues were mentioned less often (23 %). Direct synergies between REDD+ and biodiversity conservation were assumed by most actors and few concrete risks and corresponding safeguards were mentioned. Actors mentioned 177 biodiversity conservation values, which were classified into different value types. Most values were aspects of biodiversity with direct or indirect use values (68 %). Aspects which potentially provide future benefits (option values) or resilience values were mentioned less often (5 and 16 %, respectively). The opportunity to foster conservation of use values as additional benefits from REDD+ is generally recognised by the actors, but aspects of biodiversity that are important for the long-term integrity of forest ecosystems received less attention. It is thus important to push for the integration of respective safeguards in REDD+ strategies.

Over 110 million records are already being served from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, our ability to use this information effectively for ecological research, management and conservation lags behind. A solution is a web-based Geographic Information System for enabling visualization and analysis of this rapidly expanding data resource. In this paper we detail a case study system, GBIF Mapping and Analysis Portal Application (MAPA), developed for deployment at distributed database portals. Building such a system requires overcoming a series of technical and research challenges. These challenges include: assuring fast speed of access to the vast amounts of data available through these distributed biodiversity databases; developing open standards based access to suitable environmental data layers for analyzing biodiversity distribution; building suitably flexible and intuitive map interfaces for refining the scope and criteria of an analysis; and building appropriate web-services based analysis tools that are of primary importance to the ecological community and make manifest the value of online biodiversity GBIF data. After discussing how we overcome these challenges, we provide case studies showing two examples of the use of GBIF-MAPA analysis tools. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This may affect deadwood affiliate biodiversity negatively, given that stumps constitute a large proportion of the coarse deadwood in young managed forests. Spatial decision support for evaluating the integrated effects on biodiversity and production of stump harvesting is needed. We developed a spatially explicit decision support system (called MapStump-DSS), for assessment of tree stump harvesting using biodiversity and economic criteria together with different scenarios for biodiversity conservation and bioenergy market prices. Two novel key aspects of the MAPStump-DSS is that it (1) merges and utilizes georeferenced stump-level data (e.g., tree species and diameter) directly from the harvester with stand data that are increasingly available to forest managers and (2) is flexible toward incorporating both quantitative and qualitative criteria based on emerging knowledge (here biodiversity criteria) or underlying societal drivers and end-user preferences. We tested the MAPStump-DSS on a 45 ha study forest, utilizing harvester data on characteristics and geographical positions for >26,000 stumps. The MAPStump-DSS produced relevant spatially explicit information on the biodiversity and economic values of individual stumps, where amounts of ""conflict stumps"" (with both high biodiversity and economical value) increased with bioenergy price levels and strengthened biodiversity conservation measures. The MAPStump-DSS can be applied in practice for any forest site, allowing the user to examine the spatial distribution of stumps and to obtain summaries for whole forest stands. Information depicted by the MAPStump-DSS includes amounts, characteristics, biodiversity values and costs of stumps in relation to different scenarios, which also allow the user to explore and optimize biodiversity and economy trade-offs prior to stump harvest."

The cumulative effects of past development are already being felt within the Treaty 8 First Nations of the region but these effects have not been quantified from a landscape point of view. Using habitat modeling and GIS analysis the effects of 35 years of agricultural and industrial development on forest biodiversity and ecological integrity were investigated for a 410,000 ha landscape in north-eastern British Columbia. The study identified a significant increase in area impacted by developments which lead to a shift in landscape structure and significant change in forest biodiversity. Forest fragmentation and habitat loss has resulted in an increase in open, early seral and edge habitats at the expense of contiguous mature forests. The change in landscape structure resulted in a significant increase in species richness as generalist and early seral species responded positively to increases in these habitats. A significant increase in brown-headed cowbird parasitism risk was also detected. Changes in landscape structure, reduction in habitat for 22% of modeled species, increase parasitism and predation risk due to fragmentation, and increased access have resulted in a cumulative effect of recent resource development on ecological integrity that is both additive and synergistic. The propose acceleration of future development will increase the risk to maintaining the biodiversity and ecological integrity in the Peace-Moberly region of British Columbia.

The development of a Bayesian network model that examines the trade-offs between the conservation value of the landscape for a range of taxa (flora, mammals, birds and herpetofauna) and its primary production value under alternative land uses is described. The model emphasises structural diversity of vegetation and ecosystem productivity as key drivers of both biodiversity and agricultural production. Simple scenarios, used to examine the influence of different land uses on multiple components of biodiversity and agricultural productivity, demonstrated the potential for the analysis of the trade-offs associated with alternative landscape designs. The potential of the model, as a planning or policy development tool for land management agencies or regional Natural Resource Management bodies, at multiple scales, is identified.	Waters, C.

This paper empirically examines the intentions of foresters to conserve habitats beyond what is the minimum legally defined requirement when planning forestry operations: either by delineating particular habitats defined in the Finnish Forest Act completely outside the operation, despite this not being the obligation, or by delineating other valuable habitats that are not defined in the law. This type of voluntary exceeding of minimum conservation requirements is dependent on professional judgment, which is the focus of this article. The analysis applies the theory of planned behaviour, according to which intentions to behave in a particular fashion are influenced by attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived control over the behaviour. The investigation pays attention to behavioural and normative beliefs as well as other contextual factors influencing habitat delineation practice. The data consist of 311 survey responses (response rate 58%) of Finnish foresters planning forestry operations in non-industrial private forests, employed by public, private and associational organisations. The model is rather powerful in explaining intentions to exceed the minimum requirements. We find social norms to have a strong influence on delineation intentions. This effect is stronger in the case of delineation of other valuable habitats than in the more standardised delineation of legally defined habitats where the foresters have broader experience and consider themselves more autonomous. Normative beliefs relative to other foresters' expectations dominate the general subjective norm, signalling a primacy of a professional norm and the importance of peer networks. Also the general attitude has a strong influence on intentions, whereas the effect of perception of control is low. Past behaviour predicts intentions, which implies tradition and habit to have an important role in defining the way biodiversity conservation is integrated into forest management. In other words, abrupt changes are unlikely to occur in an institutionalized practice. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of policy implementation as well as governance of multiple functions of forests more generally. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Studies over time provide exceptional opportunities to detect the effects of extreme climatic events and to measure their impacts by quantifying rates of change at population and community levels. In this study, we show how an extreme storm event affected the dynamics of benthic coralligenous outcrops in the NW Mediterranean Sea using data acquired before (2006-2008) and after the impact (2009-2010) at four different sites. Storms of comparable severity have been documented to occur occasionally within periods of 50 years in the Mediterranean Sea. We assessed the effects derived from the storm comparing changes in benthic community composition at sites exposed to and sheltered from this extreme event. The sites analyzed showed different damage from severe to negligible. The most exposed and impacted site experienced a major shift immediately after the storm, represented by changes in the species richness and beta diversity of benthic species. This site also showed higher compositional variability immediately after the storm and over the following year. The loss of cover of benthic species resulted between 22% and 58%. The damage across these species (e.g. calcareous algae, sponges, anthozoans, bryozoans, tunicates) was uneven, and those with fragile forms were the most impacted, showing cover losses up to 50 to 100%. Interestingly, small patches survived after the storm and began to grow slightly during the following year. In contrast, sheltered sites showed no significant changes in all the studied parameters, indicating no variations due to the storm. This study provides new insights into the responses to large and rare extreme events of Mediterranean communities with low dynamics and long-lived species, which are among the most threatened by the effects of global change.

The method works along two lines, that of habitat diversity and that of species diversity. On the habitat level we measure the diversity in so called 'habitat units'. These units are divided in planar, linear and punctual elements. For each category we calculate a Shannon-Wiener diversity index and a saturation index. The latter is the ratio of the diversity index compared to the maximum diversity possible. On the species level we use the species number and diversity index of vascular plants, as measured in random sampling plots of 100 m(2) (for trees and shrubs) and 4 m(2) (for herbaceous vegetation). In addition, we also use the species number of butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. These numbers are compared with the total species number in Flanders, resulting in a saturation index per park for butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. In this way 20 biodiversity indicators are obtained. The proposed method was applied to the municipal park of Loppem (West-Flanders, Belgium), from which the necessary time budget has been calculated. Since it is the first application of a new method and no reference to other parks is available, the proposed bioindicators have been compared with criteria given in the literature on the selection of biodiversity indicators.

In arid parts of western North America, packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens preserve plant and animal remains for tens of thousands of years. Midden contents are so well preserved that fragments of endogenous ancient DNA (aDNA) can be extracted and analyzed across millennia. Here, we explore the use of shotgun metagenomics to study the aDNA obtained from packrat middens up to 32,000 C-14 years old. Eleven Illumina HiSeq 2500 libraries were successfully sequenced, and between 0.11% and 6.7% of reads were classified using Centrifuge against the NCBI ""nt"" database. Eukaryotic taxa identified belonged primarily to vascular plants with smaller proportions mapping to ascomycete fungi, arthropods, chordates, and nematodes. Plant taxonomic diversity in the middens is shown to change through time and tracks changes in assemblages determined by morphological examination of the plant remains. Amplicon sequencing of ITS2 and rbcL provided minimal data for some middens, but failed at amplifying the highly fragmented DNA present in others. With repeated sampling and deep sequencing, analysis of packrat midden aDNA from well-preserved midden material can provide highly detailed characterizations of past communities of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi present as trace DNA fossils. The prospects for gaining more paleoecological insights from aDNA for rodent middens will continue to improve with optimization of laboratory methods, decreasing sequencing costs, and increasing computational power."

However, due to the complexity of biodiversity, it is impossible to obtain complete information about the diversity of all species even for small areas, necessitating the selection of individual species or assemblages thereof as species surrogate. In parts of the world where taxonomic expertise is lacking, species identification has hindered progress in biodiversity conservation, and the only practical, relatively-accurate option, is the use of taxonomic minimalism. We carried out a rapid biodiversity assessment based on three surrogates-land-use (driver-surrogate), terrestrial arthropods (species-surrogate) and morphospecies (taxonomic-surrogate)-to determine the impacts of land-use on biodiversity of the Western Region (Ghana), an area covering similar to 4 % of the West African biodiversity hotspot. We used diversity profiles to visualize the distribution of a total of 8848 arthropod individuals over seven land-use types which define the complete heterogeneity of the landscape. Here, we present both sample and asymptotic diversity profiles of arthropod morphospecies for each land-use type and the potential of each land-use type for conserving arthropods. We conclude that (1) the morphospecies approach is useful for detecting differences in species diversity of land-use types; (2) the concept of asymptotic diversity may not be necessary for land-use based biodiversity comparison; and (3) maximum diversity profiles are useful for determining the land-use conservation values in cases where pristine areas are not available.

An application of the theory of planned behavior in fars province, Iran	Global Ecology and Conservation	01/10/2019	10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00698	10	Earth's well-being depends mainly on the conservation of ecosystem goods and services. However, biodiversity is extensively threatened in agricultural landscapes. Since farmers' decisions and practices are the main determinant factors of on-farm biodiversity conservation, this study was conducted to clarify the underlying constructs of farmers' intention to preserve biodiversity. The Theory of Planned Behavior was applied to investigate the intention of a sample of 274 Iranian farmers towards on-farm biodiversity conservation. In order to increase the predictive power of this theory, the new constructs of knowledge, moral norm and perceived threats of intensified agriculture were added to the model. The results indicated that farmers have a moderate level of knowledge about the value and strategies of biodiversity conservation. Also, they have a favorable attitude toward preserving biodiversity. However, they do not perceive enough control to engage in biodiversity conservation practices. Furthermore, the findings revealed that attitude, perceived threats of intensified agriculture, knowledge, social norms and moral norms are the most relevant factors explaining the farmers' intentions toward biodiversity conservation. In general, the results presented evidence about effectiveness of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the extended model of planned behavior on assessing the farmers' intention to preserve biodiversity. Also, the findings reinforced the available evidence regarding the significance of moral norm and knowledge in development of environmental intention. Accordingly, a number of considerations about improving farmers' intention to preserve on-farm biodiversity are recommended. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our paper represents the conditions under which the contemporary statist conservationist efforts to preserve the urban protected areas (PAs) in India induces a marginal existence and livelihood vulnerability upon the survival of the population residing within these PAs. A recent survey to Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai reflects the ways in which a politics of conservation operates not only in the rural regions but also in cities, in highly inequitable and fabricated ways. This has consequently affected the impoverished, disempowered and impecunious inhabitants who comprise a considerable segment of population in cosmopolitan Mumbai, residing within the PAs. The present article assesses the ways in which in metropolises, PAs by definition determine jurisdictions and exercise rights to exclude the social groups who are marginal and less powerful. This is to preserve a pristine people free aesthetic environment in cities, for which there is an increasing demand from the local elite. The results of the study indicate the socio ecological aspects of the conservation politics in the city of Mumbai. The emergent consequences are in terms of the questions of universal rights to the PAs or reflecting an elitist provision of environmental integrity to the privileged visitors in the city.

The complexity of the relationships between ecosystem functions and the biodiversity that supports them challenges conceptualization of ecosystem services and calls for comprehensive ecological frameworks as basis for valuation and policy. In this article, we discuss relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services in the context of the Nature Index for Norway, recently developed as a biodiversity measurement framework. We suggest supplementing the Nature Index by complementary indicators for ecosystem services, in order to consider how the ecosystem services approach as a policy tool can be enhanced by taking into account an ecological framework for biodiversity measurement.

To this aim, we selected nine dominant perennial species, namely Arbutus unedo, Cistus incanus, Lavandula stoechas, Myrtus communis, Phillyrea latifolia, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus coccifera (woody), Calamintha nepeta, and Melissa officinalis (herbaceous). We also examined the extent to which airborne bacteria resemble the epiphytic ones. Genotype composition of the leaf and airborne bacteria was analysed by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of a 16S rDNA gene fragment; 75 bands were cloned and sequenced corresponding to 28 taxa. Of these, two were found both in the air and the phyllosphere, eight only in the air, and the remaining 18 only in the phyllosphere. Only four taxa were found on leaves of all nine plant species. Cluster analysis showed highest similarity for the five evergreen sclerophyllous species. Aromatic plants were not grouped all together: the representatives of Lamiaceae, bearing both glandular and non-glandular trichomes, formed a separate group, whereas the aromatic and evergreen sclerophyllous M. communis was grouped with the other species of the same habit. The epiphytic communities that were the richest in bacterial taxa were those of C. nepeta and M. officinalis (Lamiaceae). Our results highlight the remarkable presence of lactic acid bacteria in the phyllosphere under the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean summer, the profound dissimilarity in the structure of bacterial communities in phyllosphere and air, and the remarkable differences of leaf microbial communities on neighbouring plants subjected to similar microbial inocula; they also point to the importance of the leaf glandular trichome in determining colonization patterns.

On the other hand, little is known about the importance of drainage networks in semiarid regions. The scant attention given to rivers in semiarid regions so far may in part be explained by the high intermittency and low ramification of these drainage networks and their incorrect classification as systems of low diversity and productivity. In this study, we investigated the importance of the drainage system of an intermittent river system in Brazil with regard to taxonomic and functional beta-diversity. To do so, we evaluated the importance of both tributaries (branches) (12 sampling points) and the main stem (7 sampling points).We initially modeled the spatial structure within the branches and the main stem using asymmetric eigenvector maps. We then partitioned beta-diversity values between local (biotic and abiotic) and spatial factors (positive spatial autocorrelation). The higher beta-diversity values observed for branches were explained mainly by predation and environmental selection. On the other hand, in the main stem, beta-diversity was best explained by a combination of environmental conditions and spatial factors. In general, local factors were more important in the functional approach than in the taxonomic approach, supporting their joint use in metacommunity studies. Our results suggest that fish metacommunity structure in branches may be responsible for maintaining regional patterns of beta-diversity in semiarid river systems.	Rodrigues-Filho, Carlos A.

Peruvian biodiversity experts have developed different lines of argumentation as to how to integrate conservation into the sustainable development of their country. Applying grounded theory, I define five groups of conservation narratives based on the analysis of 72 qualitative interviews with experts working in areas of biodiversity conservation. I have labeled them: biodiversity protectionists, biodiversity traditionalists, biodiversity localists, biodiversity pragmatists, and biodiversity capitalists. These groups are each discussed in connection with what they have to say about biodiversity in relation to human life, valuation and knowledge systems, participation and leadership, substitutability of natural capital, and its predominant political strategy. In a second step, a comparative analysis of the dominant and diverging political perspectives is made. I argue that by deconstructing underlying premises and ideologies, common ground and possible opportunities for collaboration can be identified. Moreover, although the presented results can serve as a discussion scaffold to organize conservation debates in Peru, this example demonstrates how the terms biodiversity and sustainability are operationalized in conservation narratives.

Their colloidal and particulate constituents, be they minerals, organic matter, and microorganisms, are not separate entities; rather, they are constantly interacting with each other. Interactions of these components control biogeochemical reactions, namely, the formation of short-range-ordered metal oxides, catalysis of humic substance formation, enzymatic stability and activity, mineral transformation, aggregate turnover, biogeochemical cycling of C, N, P, and S, and the fate and transformation of organic and inorganic pollutants. Furthermore, the impacts of mineral-organic matter-microorganism interactions and associated biogeochemical reactions and processes on biodiversity, species composition, and sustainability of the terrestrial ecosystem deserve close attention for years to come. This paper integrates the frontiers of knowledge on this subject matter, which is essential to uncovering the dynamics and mechanisms of terrestrial ecosystem processes and to developing innovative management strategies to sustain ecosystem health on the global scale.

We hypothesised that soil formation occurs in the growing medium of extensive roof greening, and that the successive development in the growing medium promotes urban biodiversity and counters habitat loss. To demonstrate this, we selected 10 representative green roofs of two different age classes within the inner urban area of Hanover (Germany). \""Old roofs\"" were constructed between 1990 and 1994 and \""young roofs\"" between 1998 and 1999. During summer 2002, the roofs were sampled to determine abundance and species diversity of cottembotans and to measure selected soil properties. Discriminant and cluster analyses, considering abiotic properties only, separated the growing media of the roofs into the groups \""young roofs\"" and \""old roofs\"". The results indicated a more stable environment in the substrate of old roofs due to advanced soil formation and improved niche occupancy of cottembotans. In the mature growing media of old green roofs, pH was lower, white C-org and N-t contents, as well as dehydrogenase activity, were higher compared to young green roofs. The cluster analysis on the substrate properties revealed young roofs to be more similar compared to old roofs, which are characterised by increasing dissimilarities. The collembolan densities were only slightly higher on old roofs (57,000ind. m(-2)) compared to young roofs (55,000ind. m(-2)). Also, differences in species richness were small with 26 and 24 species on young and old roofs, respectively. However, differences became obvious at the species level. Species diversity was highly dynamic over time, undergoing successive development comparable to that occurring in extreme soil environments like newly reclaimed mining areas. We conclude that extensive roof greening promotes urban biodiversity but does not replace nature. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."

Around the world fish assemblages are experiencing pressures from anthropogenic activities, and marine spatial planning is being established to mitigate these impacts and assist with biodiversity conservation. Information about how fish assemblages are structured across a range of spatial scales which encompass variations in physical, biotic and environmental parameters will assist marine spatial planning and management. We investigated differences in reef fish assemblage composition over three reef lines across an inshore to offshore gradient (3-23 m depth) at two marine reserves (70 km apart) in the Perth metropolitan region, Western Australia. There were significant increases in the number of individuals, species richness, and relative abundance of fish species across the shallow shelf depth gradient in the two locations. There were distinct fish assemblages associated with each reef line, correlated to depth and distance from shore. The differences across the shelf gradient, even over this small depth range, were greater than the differences between the two locations. These findings have implications for marine spatial management and the design of marine reserves that aim to conserve biodiversity. It may be most appropriate for such marine reserves to encompass a wide depth gradient, rather than a large longshore area. At the very least, cross and longshore patterns in fish assemblages should be taken into consideration and used to guide spatial management plans for biodiversity conservation.

Wetlands provide an excellent context for examining the re-working of society-nature relations in a landscape over a long duration. Wetland conditions and social-ecological dynamics show changes rapidly and visibly because they are frequently re-engineered to account for changes in both technology and social preferences. Wetlands are subject to multiple, concurrent property and access regimes that have consequences for both management and ecosystem health. We discuss the social-natural history of the Scamandre Marshes in the western part of the Camargue Biosphere Reserve using a historical political ecology approach to analyze the shifting dynamics between power relations under a variety of political-economic arrangements, and the ecology of the marsh environment. The approach highlights how historical political ecology is a means of identifying historical socio-natures and how European or national conservation actors' constructions of a place as \""natural\"" affect its use, conservation, and management. We show that contemporary ecological dynamics are best explained by past conflicts related to property claims, access to natural resources, and their effects on the flows and composition of water in the marsh. A general model of wetland transformation stresses repeated cycles of stability and upheaval, emphasizing that the lack of historical analysis threatens both wetlands and conflict resolution. No landscape is produced locally or ahistorically. We emphasize here that history is not only a hallmark of political ecology, but a way of understanding ecological changes that can help advance biodiversity conservation science and policy."

We compared two bottom cultures (Limfjorden: microtidal, wind-driven; Oosterschelde: macrotidal) and one suspended culture (Ria de Vigo in an upwelling coastal region). The sedimentary environmental conditions (mud fraction, POC, PON, phosphorus content, chl a breakdown products) were significantly elevated underneath and surrounding bottom and suspended cultures compared to culture-free sediments that were nearby and hydrodynamically similar. The relative change in environmental conditions was more pronounced in the Oosterschelde compared to Limfjorden, most likely due to differences in hydrodynamic forcing and characteristics of the mussel bed. The effect of the suspended cultures in Ria de Vigo on the surrounding sediments was influenced by local topographic and hydrodynamic conditions. The impact of mussels on the benthic community due to biodeposition was clearly seen in the community structure. The species composition changed from species which are typically present in sandy environments to more small opportunistic species, which are typically present in organically enriched sediments. The impact of bottom cultures on the benthic community due to changes in the habitat under the presence of mussels was positive, especially in the Oosterschelde where an increase in the number of epibenthic species was seen. The influence of bottom cultures on the sedimentary environment and on the macrobenthic community seems to be very local. Within the mussel site in Limfjorden, differences were detected between sites where none or almost no mussels were present with sites where mussels were very abundant.

Biological Conservation	05/01/2020	10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108552	1	Two key stakeholders primarily important for nature conservation are farmers (and their lobby groups) and conservationists. Both have substantial inputs into environmental strategies and policies calling for biodiversity conservation aimed to directly increase ecosystem services. The scientific literature concurs that as biological diversity increases so do ecosystem functions and services in grasslands. While the evidence for this is strong, the majority comes from controlled small-scale biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments. Thus, it is unclear whether the scientific basis for implementing BEF relationships into practice is sufficiently evidenced. Here we explore the applicability of findings from BEF experiments to the conservation and management of temperate grassland, a widespread and potentially highly biodiverse habitat. While we acknowledge that BEF research can reveal insights into fundamental mechanisms, the saturation of biodiversity effects at low levels and unrealistic (management) treatments widely impede the applicability of these experimental results to permanent grasslands. Additionally, the integration of BEF research results into practice is considerably hampered by experimental studies not answering stakeholders' crucial questions, e.g. is there evidence of biodiversity conservation potentials? Thus, stakeholders do not have a strong evidence base for taking decisions for the addressed management goals, except intensive production in (species-poor) temporary grasslands. If BEF work is to inform stakeholders future research needs to overcome unrealistic management, missing stakeholder involvement and ineffective communication. A new generation of applied BEF experiments employing applied, multi-actor approaches is needed to facilitate the relevance of BEF research for nature conservation, agriculture and land management.

The main diatom species of epilithon, epipsammon and epiphyton were characterized with respect to their autecological preferences (habitat, salinity, trophic status, saprobity). Three groups of diatoms were distinguished with respect to the type of substrate based on the results of benthic flora analysis: diatoms (i) of one type of substrate, (ii) of two types and (iii) those occurring on all types of substrates. Moreover, the distribution of benthic diatom communities indicates ecological differences in the study area. Marine and brackish-water species were observed in large numbers in the coastal zone of the Outer Puck Bay, whereas freshwater flora occurred with a higher frequency in the coastal zone of the Puck Lagoon. The content of polysaprobionts and of alpha-mesosaprobionts indicates that the region of the Hel Tip is highly eutrophicated and very polluted. The coast in the vicinity of Kuznica is less polluted, whereas the best environmental conditions are found in the Jurata-Jastarnia region, as evidenced by the frequency of diatoms that are beta-mesosaprobionts.

2048	WOS:A1996TW70500009	Biodiversity of soil microarthropods: The filtering of species	Biodiversity and Conservation	02/01/1996	NA	65	Decline of soil microarthropod biodiversity is described in the sequence: old forest stands, low-input grasslands, high-input grasslands (with and without the use of persistent pesticides). With this expected trend of declining biodiversity, the patterns of species losses are analysed with the use of classifications of life-history tactics, feeding guilds and tolerances to drought. Species intolerant to drought are absent in grasslands, but present in old forest stands. Also the fraction of thelytokously reproducing microarthropods is higher in old forest stands compared with low-input grasslands. The main difference between low-input and high-input grasslands is found in the feeding guild structure of the community. Low-input grasslands are dominated by (herbo-) fungivorous grazers, whereas high-input grasslands are dominated by fungivorous browsers. Application of DDT in high-input grasslands shows a high density of microarthropods with a high fraction of thelytokous reproduction, associated with a decrease in genetic variation in a thelytokously reproducing species. Patterns in species losses, the species filters, are explained and discussed. It is shown that the decline of biodiversity is not a random loss of species but follows an identifiable pattern.

In the absence of explicit national policy on biodiversity offsets, the country has relied on existing legal provisions in environmental law as the basis for offset requirements, supported by provincial guidelines. South Africa's periodic national biodiversity surveys provide scientifically rigorous quantification and mapping for individual ecosystems and finer scale surveys identify biodiversity priority areas, primed as 'offset receiving areas'. Yet despite enabling factors the use of offsets has frequently been inadequate to deliver intended biodiversity outcomes. Challenges include: (a) the absence of national policy to drive and shape offset implementation; (b) insufficient capacity to evaluate, design and implement offsets; (c) inconsistent decision-making; (d) problems establishing sustainable financing mechanisms; and (e) inadequate enforcement and monitoring, linked to poor drafting of licencing conditions and/or insufficient capacity to monitor implementation. South Africa's experience provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for making offsets work for biodiversity conservation and offers important lessons for the development and implementation of biodiversity offsetting in other developing countries.

Over the past three decades, ecologists and economists around the world have been examining the existence and use of 'ecological thresholds' in natural and modified systems, primarily as a conceptual basis for the development of tools to conserve and sustainably manage natural resources. In Australia, there has been a recent renewed interest in the definition and application of ecological thresholds in the conservation of threatened fauna and flora, modelling the impact of habitat loss, modification and fragmentation on terrestrial biota, management of pest plant and animal species, and development of natural resource management policies and plans. This paper reviews the threshold concept from an ecological perspective. It considers the definition, types and behaviour of this phenomenon. The theoretical and empirical evidence for their purported existence is reviewed and their potential utility in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management is discussed, along with key issues relating to their use.

This paper presents the results of discrete choice experiments aimed at estimating the demand for environmental and social services generated by a wildlife protection PES scheme in two protected areas in Lao PDR. The discrete choice experiments targeted international tourists sampled at Vientiane airport and the urban Lao population sampled in Vientiane City as potential buyers of the environmental and social services provided by the PES scheme. The survey was customised to a developing country context to address diversity in respondents' literacy levels, language limitations of the interviewers, socio-cultural conventions, and limited trust in confidentiality and anonymity of the survey process. The marginal benefits of the environmental services so estimated were used to inform the development of a PES scheme.

However, multi-level governance contexts can pose several challenges to achieving legitimate governance solutions. This paper reviews some legitimacy challenges in multi-level governance contexts, and analyzes eleven biodiversity governance case studies from different EU countries in the light of these challenges. Four legitimacy criteria rule compatibility, accountability, inclusion, and transparency serve as a framework for the theoretical review and for the empirical analysis. The results indicate that several legitimacy challenges can be observed in the cases: specifically the poor inclusion of relevant concerns in certain phases of decision-making processes; difficulties in being simultaneously accountable to parties representing different governance levels; or the weak visibility of the decision-making process either to the general public or to the immediate participants.

The results reveal that inbound tourism, per capita income, and population density affected the potential habitat area while population density largely affected the food production in a country. Inbound tourism and population density both deteriorate the environmental quality in a form of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption while per capita income reduces the fossil fuel energy consumption. Food exports increase per capita income, while food imports and population density both decrease economic growth. Inbound tourism and economic growth advance population density while forest area and food exports decrease the population density. The study supports growth-led tourism and growth-led food production in a country.

This paper explores whether the efficiency of sampling strategies for estimating the means of microbial biomass C (MBC) of SMUs can be increased with dsDNA as an ancillary variable in a regression estimator, leading to a model-assisted sampling strategy. The map unit means of dsDNA are unknown; therefore, to implement the regression estimator a two-phase sampling strategy is required. The two-phase sampling design was tested in three soil units of the Brtonigla area (Istria, Croatia) that are widely involved in wine production. In the first phase, 20 locations per SMU were selected at which the ancillary variable dsDNA was determined in field-moist and air-dried soil. In the second phase, a subsample of ten locations per map unit were selected at which MBC was determined. The estimated sampling variances of the regression estimator were compared with the sampling variances of the design-based estimator with a cost-equivalent number of sampling points. The model-assisted strategy was more accurate in two of the soil units in which the correlation between MBC and dsDNA was strong (adjusted R-2 larger than 0.55). Measurements of dsDNA on field-moist samples gave more precise estimated means of MBC than those on air-dried samples.	Bragato, G. ; Fornasier, F. ; Brus, D.

Increasing participation rates is critical to these schemes, as competition is required for the cost-effectiveness benefits of the tender system to be fully realized. However, knowledge relating to the drivers of landholder participation in tender programs is limited. This study aims to identify the relative importance of different drivers of participation in Victorian conservation tenders. The novel method of maximum entropy ordinal regression is used given the small sample size, and supplemented with qualitative data obtained through face-to-face interviews. The regression analysis reveals that strong relationships between agencies and landholders and a low administrative burden drive increased participation. The provision of education, support, and easily-integrated management practices, however, may drive lower participation, with landholders confident to undertake conservation activities independently of assistance. Some evidence emerges that ten-year contracts may be well-received. A key concern is low additionality in biodiversity benefits, with typical tender participants displaying a strong conservation ethic and high levels of management activity pre-participation. This work has shown that in conservation policies involving self-selection by participants, economic incentives for adoption may be less important than non-monetary drivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

6023	WOS:000381637800007	Viewing biodiversity through the lens of science ... and art!	Springerplus	7/26/2016	10.1186/s40064-016-2831-z	7	With global environmental sustainability at the crossroads, approaches are needed to build an ecologically literate culture for collective societal navigation through the intricacies of swift environmental change. This paper demonstrates a transdisciplinary approach, grounded at the intersection between the arts and sciences, to increase awareness and understanding of the current biodiversity crisis. It focuses on one aspect of biodiversity, beta diversity, which examines how sets of animal and plant species differ between habitats. Theory and real examples of beta diversity of aquatic animal and plant species from dried-out ponds in Mediterranean Spain are presented in pixelized visuals. These visuals are artistic expression of and build the prior knowledge about beta diversity, which is scrutinized subsequently with statistical analyses to support the artistic approach with an objectively identified and numerically underpinned presentation of structure in the visuals. The choice to examine beta diversity in theory and reality first through art and then through science is deliberate. Combined, these aspects examine biodiversity through an ecocentric, rather than a species-and habitat centric view, incorporate elements of surprise (how can aquatic species in dry ecosystems survive), and reduce uncertainty (by providing a common numerical yardstick for interpreting the visuals). Together they can optimize a goal-directed learning process in the viewers necessary for making judgments, inducing affective reactions, and facilitating memory and decision making. The approach presented here provides an integral qualitative and quantitative model useful for a broader inductive-deductive education process towards finding sustainable solutions as our planet moves swiftly to a future without historical analogue. Combined art-sciences approaches, as the one presented here, are useful to facilitate citizens' comprehension of the scientific and potential policy dimensions of environmental change, including biodiversity problems, especially because it is the general public that bears the costs of transformation and adaptation measures.

What is new in the science of biodiversity after the Convention on Biological Diversity is: (1) that the emphasis has moved from the species to the ecosystem; (2) that the functional significance of biodiversity has been stressed. Thus, population and community ecology along with landscape ecology, should offer the best theoretical framework to analyse what can be called 'biodiversity dynamics'. Some promising pathways and areas are emphasized and the very concept of functional diversity is discussed. Species richness, genetic variability and extinction probability are closely linked with landscape traits such as habitat diversity, structural heterogeneity, patch dynamics and perturbations. Thus, it is suggested that landscape ecology hold a central role, since it will allow the response to biodiversity issues in the framework of environmental heterogeneity and patchiness.

In many situations, whether the removal of an invasive plant is of net benefit to biodiversity is poorly assessed. We undertook a 10-year study on the effects of invasive shrub management (bitou bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata) on native flora and fauna in a eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. Bitou bush eradication is a management priority, yet the optimal control regime (combination of herbicide spray and fire) is difficult to implement, meaning managed sites have complex management histories that vary in effectiveness of control. Here we test the long-term response of common biodiversity indicators (species richness, abundance and diversity of native plants, birds, herpetofauna and small mammals) to both the management, and the post-management status of bitou bush (% cover). While average bitou bush cover decreased with management, bitou bush consistently occurred at around half of our managed sites despite control efforts. The relationship between biodiversity and bitou bush cover following management differed from positive, neutral or negative among species groups and indicators. Native plant cover was lower under higher levels of bitou bush cover, but the abundance of birds and small mammals were positively related to bitou bush cover. Evidence suggests that the successful control of an invader may not necessarily result in beneficial outcomes for all components of biodiversity.

New tools for mitigating and creating wetlands are available, including the Wetland Impact Assessment. This article explores many current issues in wetland mitigation and mitigation strategies, using case studies for illustration. We include some general guidelines for successful wetland mitigation based primarily on existing literature review in several cities. We use comparison and analyses on biodiversity improvement and various wetland functions, including flood-risk management, linking people to nature through urban regeneration, and connecting with the natural environment. Also, restoration, enhancement, mitigation, and creation analyses are included.

Avoided loss (averted risk) offsetting means compensation for ecological damage via averted loss of anticipated impacts through the removal of threatening processes in compensation areas. Leakage means the phenomenon of environmentally damaging activity relocating elsewhere after being stopped locally by avoided loss offsetting. Indirect leakage means that locally avoided losses displace to other administrative areas or spread around diffusely via market effects. Synthesis and applications. Indirect leakage can lead to high net biodiversity loss. It is difficult to measure or prevent, raising doubts about the value of avoided loss offsetting. Market demand for commodities is on the rise, following increasing human population size and per capita consumption, implying that indirect leakage will be a rule rather than an exception. Leakage should be accounted for when determining offset multipliers (ratios) even if multipliers become extremely high.

The erosion and loading of fine sediments from land, resulting in sedimentation and elevated sediment muddiness, presents a significant threat to coastal ecosystems worldwide. Impacts on biodiversity with increasing sediment mud content are relatively well understood, but corresponding impacts on denitrification are uncharacterised. Soft sediment ecosystems have a network of interrelated biotic and abiotic ecosystem components that contribute to microbial nitrogen cycling, but these components (especially biodiversity measures) and their relationships with ecosystem functions are sensitive to stress. With a large dataset spanning broad environmental gradients this study uses interaction network analysis to present a mechanistic view of the ecological interactions that contribute to microbial nitrogen cycling, showing significant changes above and below a stressor (mud) threshold. Our models demonstrate that positive biodiversity effects become more critical with a higher level of sedimentation stress, and show that effective ecosystem management for resilience requires different action under different scenarios.

We use the adjoint of a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to identify the sources and processes that control Nr deposition to an ensemble of biodiversity hotspots worldwide and two U.S. national parks (Cuyahoga and Rocky Mountain). We find that anthropogenic sources dominate deposition at all continental sites and are mainly regional (less than 1000 km) in origin. In Hawaii, Nr supply is controlled by oceanic emissions of ammonia (50%) and anthropogenic sources (50%), with important contributions from Asia and North America. Nr deposition is also sensitive in complicated ways to emissions of SO2, which affect Nr gas-aerosol partitioning, and of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which affect oxidant concentrations and produce organic nitrate reservoirs. For example, VOC emissions generally inhibit deposition of locally emitted NOx but significantly increase Nr deposition downwind. However, in polluted boreal regions, anthropogenic VOC emissions can promote Nr deposition in winter. Uncertainties in chemical rate constants for OH + NO2 and NO2 hydrolysis also complicate the determination of source-receptor relationships for polluted sites in winter. Application of our adjoint sensitivities to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios for 2010-2050 indicates that future decreases in Nr deposition due to NOx emission controls will be offset by concurrent increases in ammonia emissions from agriculture.

Two different monitoring approaches were used to assess macrofungal biodiversity in broadleaf Mediterranean forests in order to determine whether different sampling efforts can provide statistically similar diversity indices. Despite the different number of field visits, the results obtained show that some biodiversity indices (e.g. Shannon index, Eveness, Simpson index) values do not seem to be significantly affected by the survey approach chosen and a single survey per year has achieved comparable results to multiple surveys. This, in a wider biodiversity context it could produce a quick field methodology to study complex taxonomic groups, such as macrofungi.

However, their ability to accomplish this is often beset by poor implementation in practice. This is testament to a widening gap between the rate of policy development and implementation of MBIs and the maturity of research and evaluation on their design, and impact on affected stakeholders. Within this context, this paper examines multi-stakeholder perspectives to the adoption of Biodiversity Offsetting in England, an instrument designed to enable biodiversity losses in one place to be compensated through conservation improvements elsewhere. Analysis reveals issues associated with social and ecological compensation of biodiversity loss. Findings suggest that there is a need for a broader consideration of issues surrounding distributive justice, access to nature and the status of ownership over sites of common heritage when accounting for biodiversity loss and its compensation. This message is salient to both the study context as well as the burgeoning international practice of Biodiversity Offsetting.

Although habitat restoration can reverse this process, it is often limited in scope by socioeconomic constraints. Here we present a grassland restoration project that is exceptional in spatial scale in Europe. Location: A total area of 760 ha of arable land was restored in the Egyek-Pusztakocs unit (50 km(2)) of Hortobagy National Park, east Hungary, between 2005 and 2008. Methods: Restoration targeted alkali steppes and loess grasslands by sowing seeds of either two (alkali) or three (loess) foundation grass species. In 2009, we surveyed the vegetation in restored and target grasslands and quantified the factors influencing restoration success in a space-for-time substitution design. Results: We recorded 100 species of flowering plants, of which 37 species were non-weed, 'target' species. Annual weeds dominated 1-yr-old fields but had decreased dramatically by the third year due to a developing perennial grass cover. Former alfalfa fields had proportionally fewer weeds than former cereal and sunflower fields. The diversity of common species and the cover of target species increased from 1- to 4-yr-old restored fields. Alkali-restored fields had more heterogeneous vegetation and more species than loess-restored fields. Distance to the target vegetation did not directly affect vegetation variables. There was significant spatial variability in vegetation development, possibly suggesting several local pathways of succession. Conclusions: Grassland restoration was generally successful in accelerating secondary succession towards alkali steppes and loess grasslands. However, further management is necessary to counter the homogenizing effects of litter accumulation, to reduce perennial weeds and to enhance the colonization of target species. Our project provides useful practical insights into grassland restoration and in applying restoration at a number of sites within a larger area to conserve biodiversity at the landscape scale.

We clarify the link between components of the economic value of soil biodiversity and their associated services of particular relevance to soils. We contend that soil biodiversity and associated ecosystem services give rise to two main additive value components in the context of risk and uncertainty: an output value and an insurance value. These are illustrated with examples from soil ecology and a simple heuristic model. The paper also points towards the challenges of capturing such values highlighting the differences between private (individual) and public (global) sources of value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Groundwater microorganisms contain a proportion of unidentified and uncharacterized ultramicrobacteria (UMB) that might play a major role in the bioclogging of geological materials. This study aimed to assess the changes in genetic and metabolic biodiversity when a community of UMB, isolated from groundwater, is stimulated to form biofilms on a ceramic surface. UMB were stimulated with aerobic conditions and injection of molasses, in reactors reproducing groundwater composition and temperature. Concentration of planktonic viable UMB, secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and biofilm thickness were monitored. The assessment of changes in biodiversity was achieved by comparing the initial UMB community to the biofilm community, using the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) method, the cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) sequences, and the Biolog microplate system. The hypothesis stating that indigenous UMB would play a significant role of in the biofilm development was corroborated. Within 13 days of stimulation, the UMB produced 700 mg L-1 of planktonic EPS and formed a biofilm up to a thickness of 1100 mum. This stimulation led to a decrease in genetic diversity and an increase in metabolic diversity. The decrease in genetic diversity was shown by a reduced number of single strand DNA fragments in the SSCP profiles. As such, 16S rDNA sequences from the biofilm revealed the predominance of four bacterial groups: Zoogloea, Bacillus/Paenibacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonads. A significant increase in metabolic diversity was shown by a highest substrate richness profile and a lower substrate evenness profile of the biofilm bacterial population (p = 0.0 and p = 0.09, respectively). This higher metabolic diversity might be a consequence of the stimulation that seemed to favor the growth of bacteria having a high nutritional versatility. Stimulation of UMB, isolated from groundwater, was effective to form a biofilm having a high metabolic biodiversity.

Farm dams as biodiversity reserves in Australia	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/10/2009	10.1007/s10531-009-9623-5	27	In many countries the ubiquitous farm dam or pond is an integral component of agricultural landscapes. In Australia there are in excess of half a million farm ponds, used largely for irrigation or for watering stock. In contrast to Europe, these wetlands are being decommissioned in response to the introduction of government policy that regulates water usage from these dams. They are also being in-filled with expanding urbanisation without consideration of their benefits as reservoirs of biodiversity. We compared the diversity of macroinvertebrates in farm dams with nearby stream habitats on a cool temperate tableland in central New South Wales. There was greater diversity in-stream than in the dams; however, dam sites showed a larger mean diversity and total diversity per site than in-stream. Species recorded in-stream were more frequently represented by single individuals while species were recorded more consistently in dams. We also observed that macroinvertebrate assemblages were more similar to those in the same dam in different seasons than to adjacent dams in the same season. Some species recorded had not previously been recorded from farm dams. In contrast to the general consensus that Australian farm dams are homogeneous environments with a range of common widespread species, we showed that they provide a variety of sustainable reservoirs of biodiversity within the landscape. They also have the potential to provide 'stepping stones' between undisturbed and modified habitats, in part countering the fragmentation that occurs as a result of agricultural practices.

Here, we evaluate a global biodiversity education campaign's impact through a repeated-measures survey of nearly 5000 visitors to 20 zoos and aquariums located in 14 countries. By comparing visitors' pre- and post-visit responses combined across respondents, we found significant aggregate improvements in their biodiversity understanding and their knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity. Respondents who reported seeing the education campaign's interpretive graphic panels and informative films showed a significantly higher aggregate increase in their understanding of biodiversity and actions to protect it as compared to respondents who did not see the campaign materials. These findings reaffirm the value of education at zoos and aquariums to engage members of the public with biodiversity-related issues. The results also demonstrate that the aggregate impact from such experiences can be enhanced through coordinated public engagement initiatives.

As the mechanism is outlined as a new opportunity, the expectations need to be analyzed relative to the ensuing changes in rights and responsibilities over biodiversity degradation, conservation and restoration. In this paper we conduct an analysis of rights and responsibilities using literature and empirical material. Our empirical case is in Finland, where ecological compensation and biodiversity offsets represent an emerging avenue for conservation. We find that rights to conservation, property and economic activity have generally not been explicitly addressed in parallel, and that the focus has been on evaluating biodiversity loss through ecological assessment or as an ethical notion. Offsetting literature focuses on developer rights to a predictable operational environment rather than on human rights to biodiversity or the property rights of offset suppliers. At the same time, the literature on offsets analyzing the responsibilities over management, avoiding degradation and meeting societal expectations, has placed much emphasis on governance and control by authorities. These analyses result in doubts and criticism of the capacity of governance arrangements to reach the set targets. Echoing the literature, the Finnish case shows that even though the mechanism is framed as a way to place the responsibility onto developers, numerous responsibilities are expected to be taken by authorities or a yet non-existing mediating actor, while developer rights are expected to be secured and landowner rights are either mostly assumed not to change, or not addressed at all. Our study shows that the assumptions on rights and responsibilities need to be exposed to empirical analysis, to support the design of meaningful new institutional arrangements.

Here, we propose a biodiversity intactness index (BII) for assessing progress towards this target that is simple and practical - but sensitive to important factors that influence biodiversity status - and which satisfies the criteria for policy relevance set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Application of the BII is demonstrated on a large region ( 4 3 10 6 km 2) of southern Africa. The BII score in the year 2000 is about 84%: in other words, averaged across all plant and vertebrate species in the region, populations have declined to 84% of their presumed pre-modern levels. The taxonomic group with the greatest loss is mammals, at 71% of pre-modern levels, and the ecosystem type with the greatest loss is grassland, with 74% of its former populations remaining. During the 1990s, a population decline of 0.8% is estimated to have occurred.

The international MAB/UNESCO programme which was running between 1988 and 1998 was related to the land/water ecotones, mainly riparian zones. This article, inspired by this programme seeks to highlight the role of riparian processes on biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity under different climatic conditions. Their role is investigated by focusing on: i) the lateral ecotone between land and water systems, ii) their longitudinal corridor structure and, iii) the dry-wet cycles. This information is then used to suggest the value of riparian zones in landscape management. We emphasize the key roles of the ecotonal structure, longitudinal connectivity and timing of the occurrence of wet-dry cycles for riparian zones to process nitrate fluxes and to maintain high levels of biodiversity at the landscape scale. In the context of the worldwide transformations of flow regimes, the deterioration of water quality and loss of biodiversity, restoring riparian zones is both a key objective and a formidable challenge that implies envisioning the consequences of management actions on the long term, considering entire river basins, and paying attention to other environmental, regional and global changes.

In 2013, the F4-unit was divided into three subunits and planted with different compositions of emergent macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Iris pseudacorus, and a mixture of several macrophytes: F4-Reed, F4-Iris and F4-Mixed subunits). Two nine-month periods were monitored after planting, and water quality variables were measured in the inflows and outflows. Waterfowl occupation and plankton biomass were analyzed to evaluate their role in eutrophication reversion. The low removal efficiencies related to scarce vegetation development and wind disturbance in the first period, significantly improved in the second, particularly in the F4-Reed subunit (total cumulative mass removals of 438, 363 and 372 kg of nitrogen, 57, 30 and 48 kg of phosphorus and 7109, 573 and 2315 kg of suspended solids in the Reed, Iris and Mixed F4 subunits). This was due to the high continuous coverage (around 70%) achieved by reeds, but also by other species that spontaneously germinated from the seed bank (cattails, Paspalum sp). The constructed wetland significantly reduced the exported microalgal biomass, stimulated the potential mixotrophic phytoplankton groups, such as Euglenophyceae, and produced large quantities of zooplankton, particularly ostracods and cladocerans, which efficiently grazed on microalgae. The total cumulative mass removal of chlorophyll for the second period of operation represented 2.6 times more removal than in the first period. Almost 50% of the waterfowl species visiting the zone were of special conservation concern. Differences in vegetation structure between subunits drove a concrete selection of stopover sites for migratory, endangered shorebirds that had low impact on solid resuspension. Endangered, large and medium-sized waterfowl (higher impact on resuspension while foraging), more abundant in the post-breeding period, showed no preferences between subunits. This study supports the idea of recommending the configuration of these kinds of systems for managing eutrophicated waters in protected sites and enhancing waterfowl species of conservation concern.

Two recent New Zealand examples of biodiversity offsets are reviewed-while both are positive for biodiversity conservation, the process by which they were developed and approved was based more on the precautionary principal than on any formal framework. Based on this review and the broader offset literature, an environmental framework for developing and approving biodiversity offsets, comprising six principles, is outlined: (1) biodiversity offsets should only be used as part of an hierarchy of actions that first seeks to avoid impacts and then minimizes the impacts that do occur; (2) a guarantee is provided that the offset proposed will occur; (3) biodiversity offsets are inappropriate for certain ecosystem (or habitat) types because of their rarity or the presence of threatened species within them; (4) offsets most often involve the creation of new habitat, but can include protection of existing habitat where there is currently no protection; (5) a clear currency is required that allows transparent quantification of values to be lost and gained in order to ensure ecological equivalency between cleared and offset areas; (6) offsets must take into account both the uncertainty involved in obtaining the desired outcome for the offset area and the time-lag that is involved in reaching that point.

Policies that influence agronomic decisions are rarely made with an appreciation of the trade-offs that exist between food production, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. We present an approach that can reveal such trade-offs when used to assess current and future policy options that affect agricultural inputs (e.g. pesticides, nutrients) and practices. In addition, by demonstrating it in a pesticide policy context, we show how safeguarding a range of ecosystem services may have serious implications for UK food security. We suggest that policy change is most usefully implemented at a landscape scale to promote multifunctionality, tailoring pesticide risk assessment and incentives for management that support bundles of ecosystem services to specific landscape contexts. In some instances tough trade-offs may need to be accepted. However, our approach can ensure that current knowledge is used to inform policy decisions for progress towards a more balanced food production system. (C) 2016 The Authors.

With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate engineering (or geoengineering') is receiving increasing attention for its potential to limit anthropogenic climate change and its damaging effects. Proposed techniques, such as ocean fertilization for carbon dioxide removal or stratospheric sulfate injections to reduce incoming solar radiation, would significantly alter atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environments, yet potential side-effects of their implementation for ecosystems and biodiversity have received little attention. A literature review was carried out to identify details of the potential ecological effects of climate engineering techniques. A group of biodiversity and environmental change researchers then employed a modified Delphi expert consultation technique to evaluate this evidence and prioritize the effects based on the relative importance of, and scientific understanding about, their biodiversity and ecosystem consequences. The key issues and knowledge gaps are used to shape a discussion of the biodiversity and ecosystem implications of climate engineering, including novel climatic conditions, alterations to marine systems and substantial terrestrial habitat change. This review highlights several current research priorities in which the climate engineering context is crucial to consider, as well as identifying some novel topics for ecological investigation.

The extent to which the locations that are most valuable for ecosystem services coincide with those that support the most biodiversity is of critical importance when designing conservation and land management strategies. There are, however, few studies on which to base any kind of conclusion about possible spatial patterns of association between ecosystem services and biodiversity. Moreover, little is known about the sensitivity of the conclusions to the quality of the data available, or to the choice and size of the region used for analysis. Here, we first present national-scale estimates of the spatial covariance in areas important for ecosystem services and biodiversity (richness of species of conservation concern), using Britain as a case study. We then explore how these associations are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the available data, the spatial extent of our study region and to regional variation across the study area. Our analyses reveal a mixture of negative and positive associations. In particular, the regionalization analysis shows that one can arrive at diametrically opposing conclusions about relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity by studying the same question within different areas, even within a moderately small island. Synthesis and applications. In a policy context, the location-specific nature of relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity underscores the importance of multi-scale environmental decision-making, so as to reflect both local conditions and broader-scale priorities. The results also suggest that efforts to establish general patterns of congruence in ecosystem services and biodiversity may offer a less constructive way forward than do more regional approaches.

Encouragingly, complementarity-derived priority sets of focal taxa were found highly effective in representing non-target taxa in a study from Ugandan forests. It has been proposed cross-taxon congruence in complementarity is less distinct in temperate regions than in the tropics, because temperate regions have fewer species, and hence focal taxa may be less effective as they are less diverse. To test this, we used all available atlas data (10 x 10 km scale) in Denmark (butterflies, birds, amphibians, reptiles, large moths, bats and click beetles, n = 434 species), and looked at whether conservation priority areas based on one taxonomic group represent species richness of other groups in a highly fragmented landscape. We apply a new approach (based on G-statistics) that enables statistical evaluation of cross-taxon congruence in complementarity-derived priority sets. We found indications that the same taxa represented other groups effectively and exhibited cross-taxon congruence in complementarity-derived priority sets. Birds performed significantly, but relatively poorly, butterflies somewhat better and bats relatively well in representing species richness of other groups. Large moths performed best and may be an overlooked predictor of diversity in other animal taxa.

The goal of this study is to provide a refined biostratigraphic scheme for the Lower Ktaoua, the Upper Tiouririne, the Upper Ktaoua and the Lower Second Bani formations in order to locate the initial effects of the Late Ordovician glaciation on the composition of assemblages of organic-walled microfossils. Five Late Ordovician chitinozoan biozones belonging to the North Gondwana zonation are identified. During the late Caradoc and early Ashgill, no significant changes in chitinozoan assemblages are recorded that could be attributed to any dramatic climatic and/or environmental events. The almost absence of phytoplanktonic elements (acritarchs and leiospheres) and of cryptospores in the fistulosa/barbata and in the nigerica biozones are interpreted as resulting of lower offshore environmental conditions. The reappearance of a variety of palynomorphs in the lower part of the elongata biozone does not indicate drastic climatic changes but more likely a shallowing trend of the marine environment and an increased primary production, possibly related to a cooling of the surface water masses subsequently to early effects of a general climatic cooling. The first obvious evidence of the Late Ordovician glaciation occurs in the lower part of the elongata biozone, at the base of the sandy member topping the Lower Second Bani Formation. This sandy deposit is interpreted as the result of a dramatic fall of the sea level due to the development of the Himantian ice cap on Gondwana.

Such species may be especially common on islands given that some islands have had a relatively recent history of human settlement. It is likely that select island species considered native might have achieved their current distributions via direct or indirect human actions. As an example, we explore the origins of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis bermudensis) on the island of Bermuda. Considered native to the island and a distinct subspecies, this population has diverged in morphology relative to mainland North America. Using microsatellite markers and simulation of island colonization, we show that the Bermuda population of bluebirds is the likely result of a single colonization event that occurred during the 1600s, making this a cryptic invader. To our knowledge, this is one of the youngest examples of a terrestrial vertebrate cryptic invader. We suggest that the eastern bluebird is not an isolated case of cryptic invader on either Bermuda or elsewhere and that caution be exercised when studying present-day distributions of organisms.

We test and quantify the contention that different trapping methods routinely target different families. We identify the south-north (and upland/lowland) patterns and generate a set of hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location Australia and Papua New Guinea. Methods A total of 28,647 Diptera collected using canopy knockdown, yellow pan (water) traps and Malaise traps have been sorted to 56 families following these surveys. Comparative analyses across sites from Lamington National Park in south-east Queensland, Australia to the Kau Wildlife area in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea, of the dipteran assemblages, and separately, of the 14 families which collectively made up 95.8% of the sample, are presented. Results Ordination by multi-dimensional scaling and analyses of variances showed that the three methods complemented each other in terms of target families and, together, sampled a large proportion of the expected fauna of these sites. Ordinations on a method-by-method basis permitted the identification of groups of sites and analyses of variance indicated which taxa differed significantly across these groups. Main conclusions Recurrent patterns and associated hypotheses about their generation emerge from the data. These mirror floristic differences and reflect the biogeographic history of the sites since the Miocene. Clear linkages between the lowland faunas of Papua New Guinea and northern Australia are evident and are reflected in the abundances of the Dolichopodidae, Empididae, Muscidae and Tipulidae (other groupings underlined the essential difference of the New Guinean fauna which had characteristic proportions of Cecidomyiidae, Chironomidae, Dolichopodidae, Phoridae and Psychodidae). A subtropical grouping of families was evident comprising, inter alia, Chloropidae, Mycetophilidae, Drosophilidae and Phoridae which was frequently linked with the higher elevation tropical fauna at Robson's Creek, Atherton Tablelands. The long isolated, high elevation, rain-forested massif at Eungella, central Queensland often emerged as a unique entity in the analyses, characterized by the high numbers of and proportions of Chironomidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae and Empididae. This study supports the case for the wider use of Diptera in biodiversity analyses, complementing extensive earlier analyses which have used, predominantly, large coleopteran assemblages. The results indicate the potential power of family-level analyses at large geographical scales and contribute to the ongoing debate on 'taxonomic sufficiency'.

Their effects are particularly evident in aquatic ecosystems, as chemical concentrations in water, and as a disease in biodiversity and species richness. East Fork Poplar Creek and its tributary, Bear Creek flow inside the Reservation and have highly degraded natural habitats, unsatisfactory water quality and impoverished biota. PCB concentrations exceed recommended criteria for aquatic life safety and appear as a primary cause of environment degradation and reduced species richness. An uptake model, FGETS (Food and Gill Exchange of Toxic Substances) was used to analyse fish biodiversity and distribution in the two streams in relation to bioaccumulation of PCB congeners 1254 and 1260. Bioaccumulation of the two polychlorinated biphenyls was estimated in four different species of fish common in Tennessee rivers and streams: Catostomus commersoni, Lepomis macrochirus, Cyprinus carpio and Micropterus salmoides to integrate the available set of data and to evaluate the entity of human impact on these escosystems.

Twenty appropriate indicators from four thematic groups, i.e., land use management, nature conservation, landscape diversity and inherent natural quality, were selected on the basis of use in the literature, the requirement of consistent national datasets and statistical analysis. Each variable was divided into four appropriate classes to produce indicator values according to expert judgement. These classes were added together for each 1 km square to provide a single score to develop an expert system to define HNV. A statistical analysis showed there are few moderate correlations between the individual indicators, suggesting that their selection was sound. The HNV scores for all 1 km squares with agricultural land in Estonia exhibit a normal distribution. The top and bottom 10% of the 1 km squares (3707 and 3501 squares, respectively) were identified in order to investigate the structure of the data further. The former is termed Exceptionally High HNV (EHNV) and the latter Relatively Low HNV (RLNV), while the intermediate class is termed Median HNV (MHNV). The distribution of these groups in Estonia shows readily identifiable patterns linked to known biodiversity ""hot spots"". A cluster analysis within the EHNV squares produced three classes whose distribution and composition are described to demonstrate the detailed character of Estonian agricultural land with high biodiversity. The methodology is adaptable to other countries that have extensive relevant data bases. The map will be valuable for agricultural policy makers to identify zones with high biodiversity where agri-environment schemes can be targeted. Other stakeholders could also direct development away from EHNV 1 km squares. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	Kikas, Tambet ; Bunce, Robert G.

A total of 153 species were identified, comprising 61 ascomycete and 92 mitosporic taxa, and 20% were previously undescribed. About 30% of the ascomycetes belonged to the genera Annulatascus (Annulatascaceae), Aniptodera, Savoryella (Halosphaeriaceae), Ophioceras, Pseudohalonectria (Magnaporthaceae) and Massarina (Lophiostomataceae). Endophragmiella, Helicosporium and Sporoschisma were common mitosporic genera. Species overlap occurred between different streams, and a few fungi were common in Hong Kong streams. Species composition in the Tung Chung River was distinct, and factors causing variations are discussed. Sampling techniques, the ecological role and distribution of fungi on submerged wood are discussed.

A number of vulnerability assessment methodologies have been developed, from bioclimatic envelop models to more complex approaches that also consider biological traits and population status. However, the lack of comparative studies leaves the user to choose among the different methodologies without much guidance. This study applied three vulnerability assessment approaches to the Portuguese herpetofauna: (I) impact assessment approach based on bioclimatic models; (II) integrated vulnerability assessment approach, adding the evaluation of adaptive capacity to approach I; and (III) integrated vulnerability assessment and validation based on expert consultation. Results showed disagreement between the different approaches for 19 % of the species studied. Most differences were found between approach III and the two other approaches. All approaches showed advantages and limitations, the choice of a methodology being ultimately dependent on the study goals. Approach I has proven efficient to capture general vulnerability patterns. Approach II, although presenting results similar to approach I, allows for the identification of key factors affecting the species adaptive capacity and may be useful in tailoring adaptation measures. Approach III further allows us to identify knowledge gaps and to evaluate vulnerability when data availability or quality is reduced. Further, because this approach is based on an expert workshop, it has proven a perfect means to build on the vulnerability assessment results to identify indicator species and prioritize specific adaptation options.

This paper explores how criteria to identify important marine mammal areas (IMMAs) could be developed, and nested in existing global criteria. This process would consider 134 species of marine mammals. 2. Particular attention is given to two suites of global criteria to identify areas important for the persistence of marine biodiversity: Ecologically or Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) developed through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in revision through the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are seen as mutually complementary in the development of IMMAs. 3. The specificities necessary for identifying important areas at scales below the global level may vary according to the region, the biophysical requirements of distinct populations, and available data. Refining and testing the applicability of these global criteria on marine mammals at both regional and national scales will be necessary. 4. Combining area-based measures with non-spatial management actions will likely be the optimal approach for ensuring marine mammal persistence given their highly migratory nature and widespread life-history stages. 5. Capacity to enact IMMAs is strengthened by the existence of professional marine mammal associations and networks, and the recently formed IUCN Marine Mammal Protected Areas Task Force (MMPATF). The MMPATF is planning further development of IMMA criteria through joint work with the International Committee on Marine Mammal Protected Areas (ICMMPA). Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The number of scenarios has increased dramatically over recent decades, with a large diversity in temporal and spatial scales, purposes, themes, development methods, and content. Scenario archetypes generically describe future developments and can be useful in meaningfully classifying scenarios, structuring and summarizing the overwhelming amount of information, and enabling scientific outputs to more effectively interface with decision-making frameworks. The Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) faced this challenge and used scenario archetypes in its assessment of future interactions between nature and society. We describe the use of scenario archetypes in the IPBES Regional Assessment of Europe and Central Asia. Six scenario archetypes for the region are described in terms of their driver assumptions and impacts on nature (including biodiversity) and its contributions to people (including ecosystem services): business-as-usual, economic optimism, regional competition, regional sustainability, global sustainable development, and inequality. The analysis shows that trade-offs between nature's contributions to people are projected under different scenario archetypes. However, the means of resolving these trade-offs depend on differing political and societal value judgements within each scenario archetype. Scenarios that include proactive decision making on environmental issues, environmental management approaches that support multifunctionality, and mainstreaming environmental issues across sectors, are generally more successful in mitigating tradeoffs than isolated environmental policies. Furthermore, those scenario archetypes that focus on achieving a balanced supply of nature's contributions to people and that incorporate a diversity of values are estimated to achieve more policy goals and targets, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi targets. The scenario archetypes approach is shown to be helpful in supporting science-policy dialogue for proactive decision making that anticipates change, mitigates undesirable trade-offs, and fosters societal transformation in pursuit of sustainable development.

In this study we test the hypothesis that measures of biological diversity change significantly with changes in agricultural practices. In particular, we examine differences in measures of ant species diversity correlated with changes in vegetational complexity associated with the modernization of Costa Pica's coffee agroecosystem. We examine patterns of within-habitat (alpha) and between-habitat (beta) diversity in the ant community. Ants were sampled in 16 coffee farms falling on a gradient of vegetational and structural complexity. Percentage of shade created by the canopy was used as an index of vegetational complexity. As a partial indicator of the food resource base, arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps. The diversity (S, H', and E) of ground-foraging ants decreased significantly with the reduction of vegetational diversity. However, no significant changes were recorded for the diversity of the ants on the surface of coffee bushes. Similarity indices (l) showed a high-degree of similarity among ant communities in coffee monocultures but a low degree of similarity among farms with high vegetational diversity. We discuss several possible mechanisms leading to reduced ant diversity.

In the United Kingdom they are small and isolated, each exhibiting extremely variable habitat conditions, both spatially and temporally. This paper represents the first species-level study of lagoonal nematode assemblages in the UK. Samples were taken from seven ponds in a saline lagoon system on the south coast of England in order to describe the nematode assemblage in relation to habitat type and to assess the possibility of lagoonal specialisation. At each site samples were also taken, or data were already available, for salinity, sediment granulometry, sediment organic carbon content, photosynthetic pigments and lagoon topography. A lagoonal specialist nematode fauna was not identified, but it was found that the nematode communities strongly reflected the differences between environmental conditions in the lagoons. Sample and site diversity were found to be relatively similar, but the importance of habitat networks was indicated by the relatively high system diversity, species turnover being highest between lagoons with different salinity and/or granulometry regimes. Salinity was the principal factor correlated with assemblage structure and species diversity was highest at the higher salinity sites. Median salinity (averaged from weekly records over the previous 4 months) correlated more clearly with nematode assemblage structure than salinity at the time of sampling. This shows the importance of considering historical as well as contemporaneous data when undertaking ecological studies: Contemporary conditions may influence species fecundity, and therefore relative abundances, whilst historic conditions may influence species occurrence through the effects of recruitment and survival.

This highlights the need for climate-wise conservation strategies. With such strategies, a well-connected network of protected areas (PAs) is one of the most important means to support species survival. An extensive and representative PA network can enhance the resilience of regional populations of species, resulting in slower species loss in landscapes with a significant proportion of area of habitat being protected. This paper presents analyses of both the observed (1974-2010) and the predicted changes (by 2051-2080) in boreal bird populations in Finland. Firstly, the results show some general patterns of climate change on bird species: (1) species are shifting their ranges towards north, (2) range sizes of many species are declining, and (3) these changes are different in northern and southern species and in species occupying different habitats. Secondly, the paper looks more into the role of protected area (PA) network in securing birds in a changing climate and concludes that at least in Finland, open habitats, such as open mires and mountain heaths, change more rapidly in their species composition in protected areas than for example old-growth forests. However, generally, species decline less within than outside PAs showing that protected areas alleviate climate change effects on bird species of conservation concern. This finding, further supported by results from elsewhere in Europe, provides evidence for the resilience of PA networks in preserving species under climate change. Representative PA network that includes high cover for key habitats is hence needed in all latitudinal zones. The projected efficiency of the PA network in maintaining biodiversity was partly dependent on the strength of climate change varying with respect to future scenarios. This suggests that a flexibly adaptive climate-wise conservation planning is required to be better prepared for preserving biodiversity in the face of uncertain climate change. Thirdly, the paper discusses several aspects of climate change studies and avian biodiversity that have been hitherto understudied especially in the northern biomes. The paper suggests that future studies should concentrate on (1) abundance-based models and prioritisations, (2) species' adaptive capacity (ability to avoid the impacts of climate change through dispersal and/or evolutionary change) and sensitivity (limited potential to persist in situ under changing climate) to climate change, (3) the role of the landscape matrix around the PAs and (4) the effects of the biogeophysical features of the PAs themselves. In conclusion, we envision that improved assessments regarding the ability of PA networks to maintain biodiversity in northern biomes are needed to enhance our ability to perform climate-wise conservation planning.

However, several such areas in the Amazon suffer from anthropogenic pressures which prevent the fulfilment of their purpose. The objective of this study is to analyze the use and vegetation cover in four protected areas in the Amazon in the state of Maranhao by showing the threats to biodiversity by means of digital processing of satellite images in 1984, 1996, 2008 and 2017. Images from the Landsat satellites 5 and 8 were used for supervised classification and identification of deforestation in these areas. The results obtained in 1984 show a predominance of the forest class in the studied area, where the ILs Caru and Alto Turiacu stand out for presenting excellent preservation in that year. As of 2008, changes related to deforestation and the presence of secondary vegetation and occurrence of fires in the area studied were observed. In this case, the changes resulting from urban and farming expansion, and infrastructure projects (roads, highways, dams and land division), mining, illegal logging, cattle raising, among others, are easily identified by satellite images. The Indigenous Lands and Strict Nature Reserve of Gurupi are connected, representing the best and the most homogeneous Amazonian biome in Maranhao. The study concludes that of the remaining vegetation, 76.41% is within the protected areas, represented mainly in the analyzed indigenous lands. So, this study highlights that although protected areas are being constantly deforested, invaded and criminally burned, these are still the best way of preserving the biodiversity of the last remnant of the Biome in the region, and its protection is necessary for the conservation of its biological resources and vegetation cover.

This is due to projected further increases in pressures, most prominently habitat loss and climate change. In order to reduce these pressures, biodiversity conservation and restoration, as well as sustainable resource use, needs to be an integral part of sustainable development strategies of primary production sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and energy. This paper presents a model-based analysis of three alternative pathways described as Global Technology, Decentralized Solutions and Consumption Change to conserve biodiversity. Each of these pathways pursues international biodiversity goals together with a broader set of environmental sustainability objectives, including feeding the world, universal access to modern energy, limiting climate change and controlling air pollution. We show that different combinations of bio-physical measures, ecosystem management changes and behavioural changes can globally substantially reduce biodiversity loss in the coming decades (avoided Mean Species Abundance (MSA) loss is 4.4-4.8% MSA, compared to 9.5% MSA loss in the Trend), although the types of biodiversity conserved in the pathways will be different. The agricultural and forestry sectors together have until 2010 globally caused almost 60% of the total reduction in terrestrial biodiversity in MSA terms and 55% of the expected loss up to 2050. We show that increased productivity by technological improvements, increased use of ecological methods in agriculture and forestry, and consumption changes help to avoid biodiversity loss by 3.1-3.5% MSA. In addition, combinations of pathways, taking into account specific regional contexts, might result in even larger reduction of biodiversity loss. The changes needed in the agricultural and forestry sector to achieve this go well beyond current efforts to reduce their impact on biodiversity.	Kok, Marcel T.

To test this assumption, we compared the impact of four common silvicultural systems on bird communities, defined by cutblock size (large in even-aged silvicultural systems/smaller in uneven-aged silvicultural systems) and tree species composition (spruce/beech) in the Belgian Ardenne where beech forests have been replaced by spruce plantations. The abundances of bird species were surveyed in young, medium-aged and mature stands in 3-5 forests per silvicultural system (66 plots in all). The effect of silvicultural systems on bird species richness, abundance and composition were analysed both at the plot and at the silvicultural system levels. In plots of a given age, beech stands were richer in species. The composition of bird species at the plot level was explained by stand age and tree composition, but weakly so by stand evenness. For the silvicultural systems, bird species richness was significantly higher in even-aged and in beech forests, and bird species composition depended on the silvicultural system. This study emphasises the importance of maintaining native beech stands for birds and suggests that uneven-aged management of conifer plantations does not provide a valuable improvement of bird diversity comparatively with even-aged systems.	de Warnaffe, Gaetan du Bus ; Deconchat, Marc	2	4906061 ; 1638072	Belgium ; France	silvicultural system ; biodiversity ; bird communities ; silvicultural cycle ; coniferous plantation	2008	Diego Fontaneto	yes	Palearctic	Belgium	2000	Terrestrial	plantation forests	Field sampling	0	0	traditional survey	biodiversity in plantation forests	1	1	1	birds	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA

As a result, certain forest areas have been included in this network listed as 9230-Quercus pyrenaica habitat and 9340-Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia forest habitat. These areas were previously used for firewood extraction or livestock grazing and browsing. Nowadays these habitats are coppice forests with asexual regeneration, which is far from the desired conservation status. Traditional timber harvesting plans do not take account of the new objectives required for these Natura sites, which attempt to ensure biodiversity and recreational uses instead of simply focusing on timber production. This paper proposes a flexible methodology (applied to the study area \""Dehesa Boyal\"" in Avila, Spain) for managing Natura 2000 forest sites by stands for sustainable forest management and the new requirements. The methodology has two phases. The first, \""Division of the forest area into stands\"", defines homogeneous patches of vegetation distinct in species composition, physiognomic structure and future management. The second, \""Conservation status assessment of stands\"", quantifies the conservation status of each previously classified stand considering a series of factors such as: functional health, restoration, floral richness and structure. A total value integrating the conservation status of stands is then calculated for the habitat. Both phases use Geographic Information System tools for managing information and visualizing results. The proposed methodology provides forest managers with a good knowledge of the territory and subsequently enables them to take appropriate conservation measures to maintain biodiversity."

Predictions were made both at the scale of the Fynbos Biome (the dominant vegetation assemblage in the CFR) and for selected Proteaceae species. Bioclimatic modelling identified parts of the biome at particular risk from climate change. Species-level modelling (Generalised Additive Modelling) was done for 28 Proteaceae species selected from areas at high risk of biome loss, revealing individualistic range changes in a pattern broadly consistent with biome modelling results. Most species experienced potential range contractions (17 of 28), of which five showed range elimination. Several species (I I of 28) showed potential range expansions. For species showing range contractions, current land transformation had less impact on future potential ranges than did climate change, because many species ranges shifted to higher altitudes where land transformation is currently less prevalent. Fewer than half of the high-risk species showed overlap between current and future potential range, showing that propagule transport, establishment of species in novel ranges and conservation of landscape linkages will be critical for maintenance of biodiversity. Methods described here provide useful forecasts of potential climate change impacts that could guide conservation responses, but results need cautious interpretation in the light of the many assumptions underlying the techniques used.

At the same time there was a new elaboration of the concept of ecosystem services and, since 1997, there have been attempts at costing in money terms the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity, including the high profile TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) project (2008-2011). Our discussion rests on instances showing the analytical implications of three main socio-economic meanings of biodiversity loss: 1) the loss of natural capital; 2) the loss of ecosystem functions; and 3) the loss of cultural values and human rights to livelihood. We review several approaches to include economic considerations in biodiversity conservation. We show cases where monetary valuation is relevant and other cases where it is controversial and even counterproductive, as it undermines the objectives of conservation.

Principal players in this biodiversity are arthropods that help to decompose litterfall, favoring the recycling of nutrients and, hence, are an important part in sustaining the forest fragments that remain in urban areas. Therefore, it is important to study arthropod biodiversity in green urban areas, especially those areas where litterfall management is an important part of maintaining biodiversity. Accordingly, this study evaluated arthropod diversity associated with litterfall in three urban forests with different size and litterfall management practices, including Agua Branca Park (ABP) and Tiete Ecological Park (TEP)-Nucleo Engenheiro Goulart in Sao Paulo City and Chico Mendes Park (CMP) in Osasco City, all belonging to the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), Brazil. Four litterfall harvests were carried out in each park between April and August of 2015 with twelve samples collected with a wood mold (30-cmx30-cm) at randomly points on the forest floor. The collected material was then screened in the laboratory and the arthropods were visually separated and preserved in alcohol 70%. Arthropods were classified by the order to which they belonged. Litterfall was dried in a forced air oven at 65 degrees C for seven days. Dried litterfall was then separated into leaves, branches, reproductive parts and miscellaneous fragments and weighed. Arthropod diversity was measured by Shannon, Margalef and Pielou indexes and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) using the Manhattan distance index. Litterfall weight was compared by one-way ANOVA. The orders Hymenoptera, Collembola and Isopoda were dominant in CMP, ABP and TEP, respectively but multiple rare orders had a presence in all parks, albeit at different abundance. NMDS showed abundance similarity among the parks; however, TEP showed greater richness, Shannon diversity and evenness. The fractions of leaf litterfall and reproductive parts were different between the CMP and TEP. Overall, our results confirm that neither litterfall management, nor park size, is a final determinant of arthropod distribution, even though the abundance of dominant species was shown to differ in each park.

There are a total of 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world, among which the Eastern Himalayan (EH) range is one of the richest with nearly 750,000 sq. km area covering Nepal, Bhutan, and the Indian states of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, southeast Tibet (China) and northern Myanmar. Among these countries, Bhutan is the only one sharing all its land area as the EH region occupying a major share of 7.60% of the total EH area. Bhutan is part of 23 important bird areas, 8 ecoregions, important plant areas and wet-lands with 2 Ramsar areas - Tashiyangtse and Wangdue. It is also among the exclusive biodiversity hotspots in the world where forest coverage has increased above 72% of the country's total area. The country is gifted with enormous forest cover of 70.46% of the total land part. It also has 10 protected areas (PAs) with biological corridors that are home to mass populations of vulnerable Takin, endangered one-horn rhino, pigmy hog, leopard, red panda, etc. and also varying bird species. Bhutan also has many hot-water springs which are believed to have medicinal properties to cure diseases. The EH is now experiencing widespread warming higher than 0.01 degrees C per year. Due to global warming, slow melting of the EH glaciers may cause huge floods in Bhutan in future resulting into loss of keystone species. India may also be affected by these future floods. In order to achieve sustainable development using this unique biodiversity hotspot, management of PAs, use of non-timber products and less urbanization are required.

Diversity estimation theory statistically uses species occurrence records and sampling completeness (coverage) to predict diversity in terms of species richness, dominance and evenness. We estimated Scleractinia coral species diversity at different spatial resolutions, based on 109,296 occurrences and range data for 697 species, using an incidence-based Hill's numbers approach through a rarefaction and extrapolation technique. We found that spatial patterns of diversity estimates were dependent on a geographic scale. The latitudinal and longitudinal diversity gradients, particularly at finer spatial scales, differed from species range-based coral biodiversity hotspots of previous studies. The western Indian Ocean was predicted to have the most coral species, with greater diversities than in the Indo-Pacific Coral Triangle. We concluded that the identification of marine biodiversity hotspots is sensitive to species commission errors (from range maps) and biased sampling coverage. Moreover, estimates of the geographic distribution of species richness informed us of a set of priority areas (the northeastern coast of Australia, central Coral Triangle and coast of Madagascar) for future sampling of unknown coral species occurrence. Our findings of biogeographical survey priorities contribute to filling biodiversity shortfalls for tropical coral reefs through sampling completeness, and consequently for development of conservation planning.

It evaluates the analyzed habitats in terms of the influence of water physical and chemical parameters on the characteristics of beetle assemblages. The assessment of beetle communities was performed from the point of view of ecology and nature conservation. The analyzed physical and chemical parameters of water as well as the presence of certain species, mainly rheophiles, indicate very weak eutrophication of the ponds. The parameters which most significantly distinguish gravel pits from clay pits are specific conductivity, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-) and Cl-. The PCA analysis, however, suggests that the abundance and species richness as well as the biodiversity of beetles living in the analyzed ponds were most closely correlated with temperature and with NH4-N, total N and the BOD5 of water. The analyzed ponds proved to be very attractive habitats populated by numerous species, including rare, threatened (listed in the Polish Red Book of Species) and termophilous ones, or organisms valuable to Polish wildlife for other reasons. They include two species rare in Poland-Hydrochus ignicollis and Ochthebius hungaricus, one species fully protected in Poland-Hydrophilus aterrimus (VU), as well as Haliplus fulvicollis (VU) and Gyrinus caspius (EN). The findings are important for the preservation of biodiversity, both locally and on a scale surpassing the region, a conclusion which highlights the value of anthropogenic ponds such as clay pits and gravel pits, in the ecological landscape and implies that they deserve an adequate protection in order to sustain their function.

Estimating biodiversity and its change in space and time poses serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements of biodiversity and its change are scale-dependent. Therefore, comparisons of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried out across scales. Simulations can be used to study the behaviour of biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are system specific, plagued by large parameter spaces, and therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation framework as important tool for ecologists. 2. Here, we present the R package mobsim that allows users to simulate the abundances and the distributions of individuals of different species in a spatially explicit landscape. Users can define key properties of communities, including the total number of individuals, the species-abundance distribution (SAD) and the degree of intraspecific spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions that derive biodiversity measures, such as rarefaction curves and species-area relationships (SAR), from simulated communities or from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different sampling designs. 3. We show several example applications of the package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the fundamental components that underlie biodiversity: (i) total abundance, (ii) species-abundance distribution and (iii) species aggregation. Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be applied to assess the performance of species-richness estimators. The latter indicates how spatial aggregation challenges classical non-spatial species-richness estimators. 4. mobsim allows the simulation and analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling designs in a comprehensive way by directly manipulating key community properties. The simplicity and control provided by the package also makes it a useful didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of real-world data that exhibit sampling effects and scale dependence.

Such areas are dominated by Mediterranean woody vegetation (shrubland and woodland). An analysis of these refugia elucidates their spatial distribution at the landscape scale. Objectives Explore whether potential refugia, detected using the upper quantile of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are related, in space and time, with the survivability of rare species in dry environments. Methods We used upper NDVI quantile (25%) values to predict potential refugia in nine selected areas in northern parts of Israel from 1992 to 2011. Next, we developed an index based on the ratio of density (number of observations per area) of rare species in non-refugia versus refugia patches, per site (density of rare species index, DRSI). Finally, we examined the temporal stability of the DRSI using ANOVA and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. Results Refugia classifications and DRSI values for all areas were stable over time (1992-2011). The DRSI values were significantly lower than 1; that is, the density of rare species in the predicted refugia areas was higher than in non-refugia areas. Conclusions We assumed that patches of dense woody vegetation, determined by the upper 25% quantile of the NDVI, could be used to identify potential biodiversity refugia in dry environments. This assumption was validated by the DRSI results; it confirms that the local conditions in refugia support rare species."

The Albertine Rift region in East Africa is one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots due to dense smallholder agriculture, high levels of land and resource pressures, and habitat loss and conversion. Results of three separate household surveys conducted in the vicinity of Kibale National Park during the late 2000s indicate that farmers are concerned with variable precipitation. Many survey respondents reported that conditions are drier and rainfall timing is becoming less predictable. Analysis of daily rainfall data for the climate normal period 1981 to 2010 indicates that total rainfall both within and across seasons has not changed significantly, although the timing and transitions of seasons has been highly variable. Results of rainfall data analysis also indicate significant changes in the intra-seasonal rainfall distribution, including longer dry periods within rainy seasons, which may contribute to the perceived decrease in rainfall and can compromise food security. Our results highlight the need for fine-scale climate information to assist agro-ecological communities in developing effective adaptive management.

These potentials can be quantified as information entropy of the corresponding ecosystem type. The hypothesis is verified for the diversity of plant species. A vegetation database of North-Central European forests containing more than 12000 releves is analyzed computationally. The samples are classified into ecosystem types that are homogeneous with respect to vegetation patterns, ecological site factors, and, implicitly, with respect to ecosystem processes. Growing numbers of releves are selected randomly from the representatives of different ecosystem types and investigated mathematically. Shannon information (product of logarithmic species number and evenness) obeys a hyperbolic saturation equation approaching a finite value on infinite area. This asymptotic limit defines the ecological potential of species diversity. Within a given plant-geographical region, it is determined by ecological site factors like climate and soil controlling interrelations between plants. Competition relationships and hence potentials of phytodiversity are altered by management significantly. The curve of evenness versus area size is hump-shaped. Maximum evenness is proportional to the ecological potential of species diversity. The area size where evenness attains its maximum can be interpreted as the minimum area of the respective forest type. The ecological potentials of plant species diversity modelled from information entropies correspond to vegetation patterns consisting of a limited number of plant species. These vegetation patterns are closely related to ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling, plant nutrition, evapotranspiration, microbial processes, or net-primary production. Revealing the relationships between vegetation patterns and ecosystem processes allows scaling functional information from local measurement scales up to regional scales. It is suggested to explore genetic, proteomic, and species data in order to derive comprehensive ecological potentials of biodiversity on various levels from population to landscape. The expected results could improve the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning as well as the sustainability of ecosystem management. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Fifty-two study areas, sparsely distributed along the hydrographic basins of the main rivers and in the main environmental types available in the region, were carefully surveyed over more than two years. Seven Chelonian species were found; four of them (Pelomedusa subrufa olivacea, Pelusios c. castaneus, Kinixys belliana nogueyi, Kinixys erosa) were recorded for the first time inside the Niger Delta region. P. castaneus, P. niger, and K. homeana appeared to be common, whereas K. belliana was extremely rare. In general, species were recorded mainly from the areas characterized by dominant deltaic swamp forest, but the distribution of P. castaneus exceeded by far the distribution of this habitat in the study region. A statistical model (based on logistic regression method) was applied to evaluate the effects of the macro-environmental variables on the local distribution of the various species. It resulted that a determinant factor for the presence of the species was: (i) the presence of Primary Dry Forest for P. castaneus and P. niger; (ii) the presence of Secondary Dry Forest for PC homeana, but the presence of both Shrubland and Farmland/Plantation was not determinant for the presence of any species; (iii) the presence of Primary Swamp Forest for P. niger: (iv)the presence of Secondary Swamp Forest for P. subrufa, K. erosa, and K. homeana: (v) the presence of Mangrove Formations for Fl niger and K. homeana; (vi) the presence of Permanent Big Water-Bodies (rivers, creeks) for P. subrufa. The combination of Primary Dry Forest and Secondary Swamp Forest would be determinant for the presence of live of seven species, thus demonstrating to be a crucial combination of habitats from the conservationistic point of view. Principal Component Factor Analysis classified the seven Chelonian species and the eight macro-environmental parameters into five groups: (I)a group formed by P. subrufa and K. belliana; (2)a group formed by the macro-environmental parameters \""Shrubland\"" and \""Farmland/Plantation\""; (3) a group, relatively close to the group IZ!, formed by the macro-environmental parameters \""Secondary Dry Forest\"" and \""Secondary Swamp Forest\"", and by the species K. erosa and K. homeana; (4) a group formed by the macro-environmental parameters \""Primary Dry Forest\"", \""Primary Swamp Forest\"", and \""Permanent big Water Body\"", and by the species Fl castaneus, P. niger, and Trionyx triunguis; (5) a group formed by the macro-environmental parameter \""Mangrove\"" alone. Phenology data suggested that only one of seven, if any, species could aestivate during the dry season: P. subrufa."

Biodiversity-productivity relationships in natural ecosystems are highly variable, although positive relationships are most common. Understanding the conditions under which different relationships emerge is still a major challenge. Here, by analyzing HerbDivNet data, a global survey of natural grasslands, we show that biodiversity stabilizes rather than increases plant productivity in natural grasslands at the global scale. Our results suggest that the effect of species richness on productivity shifts from strongly positive in low-productivity communities to strongly negative in high-productivity communities. Thus, plant richness maintains community productivity at intermediate levels. As a result, it stabilizes plant productivity against environmental heterogeneity across space. Unifying biodiversity-productivity and biodiversity-spatial stability relationships at the global scale provides a new perspective on the functioning of natural ecosystems.

However, their population dynamics and the factors influencing their abundance are still not well understood. We analyzed rodent and shrew community composition and abundance at a UNESCO world heritage site, the Neusiedler See in Eastern Austria, using barn owl pellets. We identified temperature (mean and minimal monthly temperature) as well as maximum precipitation per day as significant drivers of the rodent and shrew presence. Our analyses showed that increased temperatures and dry summers will challenge most of the analyzed species and most likely lead to decreased abundances, which will also affect the already threatened Pannonic root vole (Microtus oeconomus mehelyi). Increased drainage efforts in this area would also lead to less ground water and dryer soil and therefore damage the local rodent and shrew populations. We show that barn owl pellets are a highly efficient way of monitoring rodent and shrew populations over a large area and enable researchers to decipher the factors influencing population and community dynamics. The use of pellet data, therefore, may still be one of the most efficient methods of assessing small mammal populations and their change over time.

Temperature and nutrients are the dominant factors in external conditions to influence the biological communities. To explore the influence of preozonation under low temperature, the factors such as dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NH4+-N were analyzed from the sampling ports every week; triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) and the nitrifying activity were detected along the bed height of biofilter at four levels (10, 40, 70 and 110 cm) on the 90th, 110th, and 130th day; microbial community, based on 16S rRNA gene-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), was monitored on the 130th day of the operation. The observed microbial property showed that preozonation had a positive influence on bioactivity, biomass and nitrifying activity. Community analysis showed no significant difference on the biodiversity of nitrifying bacteria between the parallel filters in the inlet end based on the method employed. This result showed that biofilters' performance is not correlated well with microbial biodiversity. The elevated functionality in O-3/BAC filters can be a result of increased microbial activity, which was promoted by preozonation.

This ongoing loss of human interactions with nature, the extinction of experience, is viewed as one of the most fundamental obstacles to addressing global environmental challenges. However, the consequences for biodiversity conservation have been examined very little. Here, we conducted a questionnaire survey of elementary schoolchildren and investigated effects of the frequency of direct (participating in nature-based activities) and vicarious experiences of nature (reading books or watching TV programs about nature and talking about nature with parents or friends) on their affective attitudes (individuals' emotional feelings) toward and willingness to conserve biodiversity. A total of 397 children participated in the surveys in Tokyo. Children's affective attitudes and willingness to conserve biodiversity were positively associated with the frequency of both direct and vicarious experiences of nature. Path analysis showed that effects of direct and vicarious experiences on children's willingness to conserve biodiversity were mediated by their affective attitudes. This study demonstrates that children who frequently experience nature are likely to develop greater emotional affinity to and support for protecting biodiversity. We suggest that children should be encouraged to experience nature and be provided with various types of these experiences.

The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is an endemic apex predator and one of the world's most endangered pinnipeds. Given that prey availability is vital to the survival of top predators, this study set out to understand what dietary information DNA metabarcoding could yield from 36 sea lion scats collected across 1,500km of its distribution in southwest Western Australia. A combination of PCR assays were designed to target a variety of potential sea lion prey, including mammals, fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and birds. Over 1.2million metabarcodes identified six classes from three phyla, together representing over 80 taxa. The results confirm that the Australian sea lion is a wide-ranging opportunistic predator that consumes an array of mainly demersal fauna. Further, the important commercial species Sepioteuthis australis (southern calamari squid) and Panulirus cygnus (western rock lobster) were detected, but were present in <25% of samples. Some of the taxa identified, such as fish, sharks and rays, clarify previous knowledge of sea lion prey, and some, such as eel taxa and two gastropod species, represent new dietary insights. Even with modest sample sizes, a spatial analysis of taxa and operational taxonomic units found within the scat shows significant differences in diet between many of the sample locations and identifies the primary taxa that are driving this variance. This study provides new insights into the diet of this endangered predator and confirms the efficacy of DNA metabarcoding of scat as a noninvasive tool to more broadly define regional biodiversity.

The Eastern Ghats region is smaller and less well explored biologically and the affinities and origins of its biota poorly understood. Our aim was to assess whether divergence between east and west lineages might have been caused by fragmentation of the wet zone during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, by Late Miocene wet-zone contraction or by more ancient events. We present the first dated phylogenetic test of these alternatives by inferring relationships and dating divergences within a wet-zone-restricted lineage endemic to the Eastern and Western Ghats. Location The Eastern and Western Ghats regions of peninsular India. Methods Molecular genetic data (one nuclear and four mitochondrial genes) were newly generated for the only known Eastern Ghats teresomatan caecilian amphibian (Gegeneophis orientalis) and the only Western Ghats congener (G. pareshi) for which molecular data were not previously available. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for Indian indotyphlids using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Divergence times within the inferred phylogeny were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed clock method, with the Seychelles versus Indian indotyphlid divergence calibrated based on the geological separation of their respective continental land masses. Results The single Eastern Ghats species of Gegeneophis is sister to all other (Western Ghats) Gegeneophis. The basalmost (and east-west) split within Gegeneophis likely occurred >35 Ma. Main conclusions Divergence between Eastern and Western Ghats Gegeneophis is too ancient to have been caused by wet-zone contraction in the Miocene or by Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Our results are consistent with a relatively ancient origin of wet-zone lineages in the Eastern Ghats and a lack of gene flow between Eastern and Western Ghats Gegeneophis for tens of millions of years.

We show here that reducing food consumption (and eating less meat) could improve Americans' health and well-being while facilitating environmental benefits ranging from establishing new national parks and protected areas to allowing more earth-friendly farming and ranching techniques. We conclude by considering various public policy initiatives to lower per capita caloric intake and excessive meat consumption, and to translate this temperate behavior into substantial environmental protection.

5775	WOS:000235096200014	Biodiversity - The appreciation of different thought styles and values helps to clarify the term	Restoration Ecology	01/03/2006	NA	22	"In restoration ecology the term biodiversity is widely used to define endpoints, to assess restoration needs, and to monitor restoration success. However, the term is far from clear because different uses of it result in ambiguities and misunderstandings. The appreciation of different thought styles, which are types of worldviews, and different values is crucial for a clearer and more consistent understanding of ""biodiversity."" Three groups of thought styles with different uses of the term biodiversity can be distinguished. (1) Natural history perceives biodiversity as biotic elements of nature that can be described and classified. (2) Science considers biodiversity as a measurable parameter that is relevant for ecosystem processes and functions. (3) In environmentalism, biodiversity is used in the context of concerns about species extinctions and habitat destructions. Values play a strong role in some perceptions of biodiversity but are negligible in others. Much confusion arises from some people considering biodiversity as something valuable per se and others seeing it as a virtually value-free parameter for the description of ecosystems. Because of different thought styles and values the term biodiversity should be used as a general concept, not as a specific element of nature. Biodiversity is a framework for the variety of life on Earth. Biodiversity in this sense is not measurable. However, specific features of biodiversity, e.g., the species richness of vascular plants, can be quantified. The selection of these features depends on thought styles and values. This implies that ""biodiversity as general concept"" should be distinguished from measurable ""features of biodiversity."" Explicit declarations of selected biodiversity features, in every case quantities are in the focus, are inevitable for an unambiguous use of the term."

231	WOS:000223426100001	Importance of bioturbators for biodiversity maintenance: indirect effects of fishing disturbance	Marine Ecology Progress Series	01/01/2004	NA	46	The relative impact on macrofaunal diversity of 7 naturally co-occurring bioturbators has been examined in a benthic mesocosm experiment, The bioturbators chosen were selected because of their potential vulnerability to the disturbances associated with demersal trawling. The experiment was conducted at the Solbergstrand mesocosm (Norwegian Institute for Water Research) using subtidal sediment collected from Bjornehodebukta, a small sheltered bay in the Oslofjord. For 3 of the bioturbating species (Brissopsis lyrifera, Aphrodita aculeata and Amphiura chiajei) a positive, linear relationship was demonstrated between bioturbator abundance and measures of species richness (number of species and Margalef species richness). It was suggested that the presence of these bioturbating species increased oxygen penetration into the sediment, leading to an enhancement in the ability of benthic systems to process organic material. This had a beneficial effect on the associated fauna in terms of maintaining levels of diversity. For Nephtys caeca, highest species diversity was seen in the low abundance treatments. Predation by N. caeca on small polychaetes is proposed as a possible explanation of the lower diversity in high-density treatments. It is concluded that B. lyrifera, A. aculeata, A. chiajei and N. caeca are functionally similar with respect to setting the diversity of the associated macrobenthic community and may therefore fulfill the same role within the benthic ecosystem. The presence of Calocaris macandreae, Nuculana minuta and Astarte sulcata had no detectable effect on diversity. Trawling has been shown to reduce the abundance of bioturbating species, and the current study demonstrates important implications of this loss on the maintenance of diversity. In addition, the interactions between bioturbation, diversity and organic enrichment highlight the need for management of anthropogenic impacts within the coastal environment in a holistic way rather than by isolation.

Water samples were collected monthly, for a year, at 16 stations along the coast line between Brindisi and Santa Maria di Leuca. The results obtained described the heterotrophic bacterial community over an annual cycle. Mean values of bacterial densities were 5.3 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in Brindisi, 5.8 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in S. Cataldo. 4.3 x 10(1) CFUmI(-1) in Otranto and 6.7 x 10(4) CFUml(-1) in S. M. di Leuca. The differences in bacterial densities between the sites considered were estimated. The hydrodynamic circulation, the trophism and the geographical position of the examined sites contribute to justify the different bacterial density trends. The bacterial community consisted mainly of the genera Aeromonas. Pseudonionas, Photobacterium and Flavobacterium. The Enterobacteriaceae represented a considerable fraction of the bacterial community in the Southern Adriatic Sea. Bacilli were predominant among the Gram positive bacteria. The enzymatic versatility of the observed genera suggest their importance in organic matter turnover of this oligotrophic ecosystem.

Previous studies in California have revealed that mechanical raking to remove wrack from sandy beaches has negative ecological consequences for coastal ecosystems. In the current study the presence and absence of eight common taxa that inhabit beached wrack on sandy beaches in Scotland was assessed at 60 sites, 24 of which were groomed and 29 of which were in receipt of a beach award. On average 4.86 of the eight taxa were found to be present on ungroomed beaches, whereas only 1.13 taxa were present on groomed beaches. Thus, beach grooming seems to be having a major effect on the biodiversity of beach macroinvertebrates in Scotland. Fewer macroinvertebrate taxa were also found on award (1.5) compared to non-award (4.38) beaches. It was also revealed that award beaches were much more likely to be groomed than non-award beaches, with 69% of award beaches surveyed being groomed compared to only 6% of non-award beaches. This pattern is surprising as the awarding bodies discourage the removal of seaweed and regulations state that beached wrack should only be removed if it constitutes a nuisance. It is concluded that award status, not nuisance level, has the main factor driving most beach grooming and that this has resulted in the substantial loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity from award beaches in Scotland. In conclusion it is shown that beach grooming has a substantial negative impact upon strandline macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Scotland and that grooming is much more likely to occur on award beaches.

Though limited to about 26% of the total land area of the country, maintaining healthy forests is vital to support sustainable development in Turkey. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the current status of Turkey's forests, present the national objectives for forest conservation and sustainable use. and describe the actions needed to protect forest biodiversity. While Turkey has numerous laws, regulations, and programmes that seek to promote biodiversity, implementation of these guidelines requires increased commitment and vigilance. Conservation programmes should be increased in number and effectiveness, particularly in light of increasing demand for forest products, Management plans for all conservation programmes require completion and implementation. Creating monitoring programs and building quantitative databases for conservation programs will be essential to assess future success in maintaining biodiversity. Conservation of natural resources requires public education and promoting awareness of the vital role of maintaining a healthy environment for sustainable development. Agroforestry endeavors can provide practical means of meeting both environmental protection and agricultural product production goals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we report the results of a recent national marine biodiversity inventory along the Swedish West coast between 2004 and 2009. The expedition revisited many historical localities that have been sampled with the same methods in the early twentieth century. We generated comparable datasets from our own investigation and the historical data to compare species richness, abundance, and geographic distribution of diversity. Our analysis indicates that the benthic ecosystems in the region have lost a large part of its original species richness over the last seven decades. We find evidence that especially rare species have disappeared. This process has caused a more homogenized community structure in the region and diminished historical biodiversity hotspots. We argue that the contemporary lack of rare species in the benthic ecosystems of the Kattegat and Skagerrak offers less opportunity to respond to environmental perturbations in the future and suggest improving the poor representation of rare species in the region. The study shows the value of biodiversity inventories as well as natural history collections in investigations of accumulated effects of anthropogenic activities and for re-establishing species-rich, productive, and resilient ecosystems.

Remains of amphibians, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, pterosaurs, dinosaurs and mammals have been recovered. The most common taxa are crocodylomorphs, and their most abundant remains are small isolated teeth. Six morphotypes have been identified, which may correspond to at least four different sympatric crocodylomorph taxa. This site presents a similar assemblage to other European Lower Cretaceous sites, with morphotypes that may correspond to the families Goniopholididae, Bernissartiidae, Atoposauridae and multiple ziphodont crocodylomorphs. The crocodylomorph assemblage of La Cantalera is characterized by the absence of large individuals and presents a wide variety of dental morphologies adapted to diets ranging from generalist to highly specialized. This rich biodiversity could be due to concentration of vertebrates into restricted flooded areas during dry seasons within a marsh ecosystem. Furthermore, La Cantalera could also be close to a nesting area, which would explain the abundance of small-sized individuals and the presence of fossil crocodiloid eggshells.

To address this issue, we examined the response of soil fauna (Collembola) to landscape heterogeneity at different spatial scales. We derived spatial features from satellite images of the Massif of Arize in the French Pyrenees. We developed a multiscale approach to test the effect of scale of the landscape pattern on species abundance and biodiversity, with a Mantel test and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, respectively. We distinguished the effect of the ""regional"" habitat (landscape descriptors) on soil fauna, which is a spatially explicit concept, and that of the ""local"" habitat (topography and forest type). We carried out a variance-partitioning analysis of species composition and richness to assess the relative contribution of regional and local habitat. The effect of the spatial structure on species abundance was especially strong at a well-defined scale of 48 ha. The surrounding environment that primarily structured the soil fauna assemblages was vegetation cover, measured as the mean of a radiometric vegetation index. Our results show that regional habitat can play an important role in structuring species composition, which is frequently hidden when the scale component is not taken into consideration. Further, we modeled endemic Collembolan richness based on a combination of landscape features at two spatial scales (2.25 ha and 292 ha). The landscape descriptors accounted for 72% of endemic richness variance, although within that variation 41% is shared with local habitat and spatial terms. We used the linear regression model to extrapolate endemism scores over the landscape. Such spatial models could be powerful tools for the selection and delimitation of high-biodiversity areas in conservation policies."

The best example of this threat is the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2. Several nonhuman primate species are endangered and might be in turn at risk of acquiring infection through human contacts, like poliovirus infection. Finally, interesting differences have been described in the degree of susceptibility to different viral agents between New World and Old World primates. For example, up to 40 different simian retroviruses have been identified infecting simians from the Old World but none has been found infecting New World primates. The study of viral infection in nonhuman primates is important for preserving biodiversity as well as to prevent epidemics with a significant impact on human health.

We examined the potential contributions of these areas to the conservation of biodiversity. Using GIS, we analyzed the concordance of inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) with ecoregion-scale biological importance and endangered and imperiled species distributions on a scale of 1:24,000. We found that more than 25% of IRAs are located in globally or regionally outstanding ecoregions and that 77% of inventoried roadless areas have the potential to conserve threatened, endangered, or imperiled species. IRAs would increase the conservation reserve network containing these species by 156%. We further illustrate the conservation potential of IRAs by highlighting their contribution to the conservation of the grizzly bear (Ursos arctos), a wide-ranging carnivore. The area created by the addition of IRAs to the existing system of conservation reserves shows a strong concordance with grizzly bear recovery zones and habitat range. Based on these findings, we conclude that IRAs belonging to the U.S. Forest Service are one of the most important biotic areas in the nation, and that their status as roadless areas could have lasting and far-reaching effects for biodiversity conservation.

Therefore, we need to identify conservation actions that can support biodiversity without taking land out of production. Previous studies suggest this can be accomplished by increasing ""farmland heterogeneity""-i.e. heterogeneity of the cropped portions of agricultural landscapes-by, for example, decreasing field sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether policies/guidelines that promote farmland heterogeneity will be as effective as those targeting farming practices. Here, we estimated the relative effects of six practices-annual/perennial crop, fertilizer use, herbicide use, insecticide use, tile drainage, and tillage-versus two aspects of farmland heterogeneity-field size and crop diversity-on the diversity of herbaceous plants, woody plants, butterflies, syrphid flies, bees, carabid beetles, spiders, and birds in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. The strength of effect of farming practices and farmland heterogeneity varied among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we found important effects of both farming practices and farmland heterogeneity on the combined (multi) diversity across these groups. In particular, we found greater multidiversity in untilled, perennial crop fields than tilled, annual crop fields, and greater multidiversity in agricultural landscapes with smaller crop fields and less diverse crops. The directions of effect of these variables were generally consistent across individual taxonomic groups. For example, richness was lower in landscapes with larger fields and more diverse crops than in landscapes with smaller fields and less diverse crops for all taxa except spiders. The negative effect of crop diversity on multidiversity and the richness of most of the studied taxa indicates that this aspect of farmland heterogeneity does not necessarily benefit wildlife species. Nevertheless, a compelling implication of this study is that it suggests that policies/guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes would be at least as effective for conservation of biodiversity within working agricultural landscapes as those designed to promote a wildlife-friendly farming practice."

4674	WOS:000251107000018	Biodiversity of earthworms in the levant	Israel Journal of Ecology & Evolution	01/01/2006	NA	4	Today, 37 species, 16 genera, and five families (Acanthodrilidae, Criodrilidae, Lumbricidae, Ocnerodrilidae, and Megascolecidae) of earthworms are known to be present in the Levant. Out of all recorded species, 35-43% (13-16 species) have been directly or indirectly introduced by humans and 57-65% (21-24 species) seem to be autochthonous. Twelve to fourteen (50-67%) autochthonous species are endemic to the Levant (genera Dendrobaena, Healyella, Helodrilus, and Perelia). The autochthonous Levantine earthworm fauna is exclusively Palearctic, and species mainly show zoogeographic affinities to Anatolia-Caucasus and Europe. No observed earthworm endemism above the species level corresponds to the expected origin of earthworm fauna in the Levant between Rupelian (30-28 Mya) and Tortonian (11.5-6 Mya) (Oligocene-Miocene). In spite of the fact that speciation in earthworms might take millions of years, the observed new species isolated in the desert oases and along the Negev and Sinai Desert borders might change this perception if we can differentiate between relicts surviving the expansion of the Arabo-Syrian desert belt and subsequent speciation.

We tested two groups of parameters as possible surrogates for species richness: (1) environmental parameters, such as climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, and (2) community parameters, such as higher taxon richness, indicator taxa, and maximum dominance. Climate and soil parameters were significantly correlated with biodiversity in all datasets. However, in spite of the large variety of measurement types analysed, prediction quality of environmental variables was weak and the explained proportion of variance ranged generally below 50%. Richness was subject to considerable stochastic variation among subsamples (CV = 20-60%) thereby evading a narrow correlation with environmental parameters. Higher taxon richness, based on taxa of intermediate hierarchical order, proved the best predictor of richness in collembola and nematodes explaining 55 and 89% of total variance, respectively. A combination of two ant species was the best predictor of ant richness explaining 59% of total variance. The authors conclude that a rough guess of soil faunal diversity can be cost-effectively derived from environmental data while an estimate of moderate quality can be obtained with reduced taxonomic effort. The precise richness of a soil community, however, is subject to autogeneous community dynamics, to biotic interactions with other populations, and to conditions in the past, and can therefore only be retrieved by immediate investigation of the community itself. Criteria for the quality of indicator parameters are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Because private land is being developed rapidly, there is heightened concern about identifying these areas. Although general principles on setting priorities for habitat protection are emerging, substantial ambiguity remains about how to implement these principles. Here, we offer a general modeling framework for evaluating how planning alternatives could affect Critical Habitat. The framework contains four components: stakeholder involvement, spatial modeling of Critical Habitat and development patterns, analysis of alternative scenarios, and evaluation and monitoring. We illustrate this approach using a case study from Summit County, Colorado, USA.

Today's geography is, however, misleading and typical of only similar to 2% of the last million years; > 90% of that time the region's land area was 1.5-2.0 times larger as mean sea levels were 62 m below today's, climates were cooler, and extensive forests and savanna covered the emerged Sunda plains. The region's land area varied two-fold as sea levels fluctuated up to +/- 50 m with each of similar to 50 Pleistocene glacial cycles, and forests expanded and contracted with oscillations in land area and seasonality. This dynamic geographic history is relevant to the development of biogeographic regionalism and shows that it is today's forests that are refugial, not those of the Last Glacial Maximum. This history affects how species will adapt or shift their ranges in response to global warming and further decreases in land area (submergence of low-lying coastal areas) during the 21st century. The alternative is mass species extinction. The biota is also threatened by the continued destruction of forest, destruction of Mekong River flood-pulse based ecosystems, and continued human population growth. Human biogeography will become more important in conservation planning as tens of millions of people who depend on protected area forests, riverine ecosystems, and coastal habitats become environmental refugees. Conservation scientists need to become more involved in regional ecological education, environmental stewardship, and ecosystem-based adaptation to sustain as much as possible of this rich biota and the ecological services it provides.

We applied five methods (photocclectors, soil traps, shaking down, yellow dishes in low and high position) in three localities of Northern Bohemia in the birch forest at the same time and we compared quantitative and qualitative properties of heteropteran taxocoenosis. Qualitatively similar samples of communities were obtained from the photoeclector method and soil traps with the dominance of epigeic species and, further, from the methods of shaking down and yellow dishes. The effectivity of sampling methods was assessed using the rarefaction method revealing a high heteropteran species richness obtained by yellow dishes as compared with abundant samples from shaking down and photoeclectors. Biodiversity measures depend on the sampling method, the lowest were in the samples collected by shaking down, while the highest species diversity was recorded in the sample from yellow dishes. For a complex species richness and heterogeneity determination of true bug communities, even non-specialised methods for heteropterans sampling should be used.

Triazine herbicides constitute the main weed control in current conventional systems, but will be withdrawn under future EU guidelines. Here, we reappraise FSE data to predict effects of this withdrawal on invertebrate biodiversity under alternative management scenarios. Invertebrate indicators showed remarkably consistent and sensitive responses to weed abundance. Their numbers were consistently reduced by atrazine used prior to seedling emergence, but at reduced levels compared to similar observations for weeds. Large treatment effects were, therefore, maintained for invertebrates when comparing other conventional herbicide treatments with GMHT, despite reduced differences in weed abundance. In particular, benefits of GMHT remained under comparisons with best estimates of future conventional management without triazines. Pitfall trapped Collembola, seed-feeding carabids and a linyphiid spider followed closely trends for weeds and may, therefore, prove useful for modelling wider biodiversity effects of herbicides. Weaker responses to triazines applied later in the season, at times closer to the activity and capture of invertebrates, suggest an absence of substantial direct effects. Contrary responses for some suction-sampled Collembola and the carabid Loricera pilicornis were probably caused by a direct deleterious effect of triazines.

We conducted a literature review of species descriptions between January 1990 and August 2014. The following metadata were recorded from each article: year of publication, number of species, journal and impact factor, family(s) of the described species, number of authors, age of the authors and coauthors, country of the first author's institution and ecoregion of the type-locality. From accumulation of descriptions, we built an estimate model for number of species remaining to be described. We found 595 described species in 402 articles. The data demonstrated that there has been an increased understanding of the diversity of Siluriformes over the last 25 years in the Neotropical region, although 35% of the species still remain to be described. The model estimated that with the current trends and incentives, the biodiversity will be known in almost seven decades. We have reinforced the idea that greater joint efforts should be made by society and the scientific community to obtain this knowledge in a shorter period of time through enhanced programs for promoting science, training and the advancement of professionals before undiscovered species become extinct. The model built in this study can be used for similar estimates of other groups of animals.

Although most research has focused on present-day climate, a growing body of evidence indicates that modern ecological communities may be significantly shaped by paleoclimatic change and past anthropogenic factors. However, the generality of this pattern is unknown, as global analyses are lacking. Here we quantify the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of 515 tropical and subtropical large mammal communities and predict their structure from past and present climatic and anthropogenic factors. We find that the effects of Quaternary paleoclimatic change are strongest in the Afrotropics, with communities in the Indomalayan realm showing mixed effects of modern climate and paleoclimate. Malagasy communities are poorly predicted by any single factor, likely due to the atypical history of the island compared with continental regions. Neotropical communities are mainly codetermined by modern climate and prehistoric and historical human impacts. Overall, our results indicate that the factors governing tropical and subtropical mammalian biodiversity are complex, with the importance of past and present factors varying based on the divergent histories of the world's biogeographic realms and their native biotas. Consideration of the evolutionary and ecological legacies of both the recent and ancient past are key to understanding the forces shaping global patterns of present-day biodiversity and its response to ongoing and future abiotic and biotic changes in the 21st century.

A total of 75 nominal species have been described, among which several have become very popular among tropical fish hobbyists because of their tendency to form large schools of colourful individuals. Facing habitat loss and competition or predation by introduced species, this group has become a priority in the conservation of ornamental fishes in Indonesia. In this context, several expeditions have been conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Indonesian Papua with the aim to initiate a large-scale survey of the genetic resources in this group. We assessed the diversity of the Papua rainbowfishes with DNA barcoding. We sequenced the mitochondrial COI gene for 350 specimens belonging to 53 nominal species throughout the Indo-Australian archipelago. Unexpected levels of cryptic diversity and endemism were detected since additional cryptic lineages were detected in several watersheds from the Vogelkop and the Lengguru massif. DNA barcoding supports the presence of nearly 30 evolutionary lineages among the 15 nominal species sampled in the Vogelkop and all these lineages are endemic to a single lake or watershed. This result highlights that the diversity of the family has been largely underestimated and urges for the identification of conservation priorities in Papua.

A rugged territory and a long history of human settlement, combined with social and political isolation, have resulted in large areas with well-preserved forests, a large number of wild plant and animal species, and indigenous crops. Several factors, including agriculture expansion, intense logging activities, and oil and gas prospecting, are posing a threat to biodiversity. Current national parks and reserves are not enough to secure the survival of functional populations, especially of the large mammals. Conservation of biodiversity in the UBRB requires a broader approach: e.g, protection of the most sensitive areas outside present reserves; maintaining the remaining forest matrix under sustainable management regimes, involving the local communities in the process; and encouraging uses synergetic with conservation. Recent purchases by private enterprises of new protected areas, the willingness of local administrations to establish a new legal conservation framework, and local communities considering sustainable management of their lands, represent encouraging opportunities for the region.

Regulatory and other interventions are needed to stop and reverse ecosystem degradation. Biodiversity offsets are seen as one possible method of mitigating the current trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services loss in the country. However, for offsetting to succeed in practice, a number of barriers will have to be overcome. This paper discusses concerns raised by South African stakeholders as part of a policy development process implemented by the Department of Environmental Affairs and proposes how the identified barriers may be overcome in the South African setting.

Sampling was limited to 0.5 x 0.5 m (0.25 m2) sized quadrats from seven locations. In total, 34 species, 27 genera and 21gastropod families were identified. Of these, 27 species were common for all sites. The maximum number of species was observed during the coldest period (winter), and minimum during the hottest period (summer). The greatest abundance was found in winter and lowest in spring. The lowest value of Shannon and Pielou indices were observed in cold (winter), Simpson in moderate (spring), Margalef and Menhinick in hot (summer) seasons. The highest values for Shannon, Pielou and Margalef was observed in moderate (spring) period, Simpson and Menhinick in cold (winter) period of the year. In general, the results showed diverse species with poor richness and low evenness in different periods in the area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Many stenotypic species typical of mire habitats were reported in these enclaves: Ceratophysella mosquensis, C. scotica, Isotomurus plumosus, Ballistura crassicauda, Arrhopalites principalis, Sminthurides schoetti, S. malmgreni, S. parvulus and S. pseudassimilis. A few rare species were also found: Isotoma neglecta, I. tenuicornis, I. ruseki, Folsomia bisetosa, Pseudanurophorus binoculatus, A. spinosus and Stachorutes sphagnophilus. The species composition, richness and diversity of Collembola communities varied according to size of peatland, mire type, water conditions, plant communities and terrain topography. However, the distribution of boreal-alpine species, that occurred in basin bogs, was not clearly related to these parameters. Cluster analysis showed a high similarity of Collembola communities of mires situated in the same geographical subprovince.

Here, we identify forests in the western conterminous United States with high potential carbon sequestration and low vulnerability to future drought and fire, as simulated using the Community Land Model and two high carbon emission scenario (RCP 8.5) climate models. High-productivity, low-vulnerability forests have the potential to sequester up to 5,450 Tg CO2 equivalent (1,485 Tg C) by 2099, which is up to 20% of the global mitigation potential previously identified for all temperate and boreal forests, or up to similar to 6 yr of current regional fossil fuel emissions. Additionally, these forests currently have high above- and belowground carbon density, high tree species richness, and a high proportion of critical habitat for endangered vertebrate species, indicating a strong potential to support biodiversity into the future and promote ecosystem resilience to climate change. We stress that some forest lands have low carbon sequestration potential but high biodiversity, underscoring the need to consider multiple criteria when designing a land preservation portfolio. Our work demonstrates how process models and ecological criteria can be used to prioritize landscape preservation for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and preserving biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate.

Biodiversity and Conservation	08/01/2017	10.1007/s10531-017-1348-2	3	Biodiversity offsetting promotes the protection or restoration of biodiversity at one site to compensate for the loss of biodiversity due to development at another site. Thus populations of species at a development site may be extirpated in the belief that offsetting elsewhere will compensate for the loss of biodiversity. In this study we tested the replaceability of roadside populations of the orchid Diuris platichila threatened by development (populations 1-5, n = 50-541 plants) with a potential offset population occurring in nearby natural vegetation (population 6, n = 143 plants). We measured differences in habitat among the populations and associated differences in flowering and fruiting. We also measured genotypic diversity within and among the populations, and the capacity of soil from each population to promote the symbiotic germination of outcrossed seed from the two largest populations (populations 1-2). An evaluation of the performance of the relevant offset policy was also undertaken which was informed by these studies. Compared to the roadside populations, the potential offset site had limited flowering (except after fire) and was genotypically less diverse. Soil from the potential offset site, and populations 2, 3 and 5, supported significantly less seed germination than soil from population 1. Translocating individuals from the most genotypically diverse populations into the offset population could help to buffer against the loss of genetic diversity if offsetting was required; however, the limited reproduction and recruitment opportunities at the offset site could result in the eventual erosion of any initial increase in diversity. The offset policy failed to secure a suitable offset for a hypothesized loss of plants. More generally we conclude that offsetting approaches which do not assess genotypic diversity and recruitment capacity may fail in their objective of protecting species and that maintaining populations in safe sites may be required.

The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of mosses, lichens and arthropods in blueberry plantations of differing age on an abandoned peat production area. In the experiment, two lichen and five moss species were detected in total. By contrast, only one species, a moss, was found on a non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Although the total number of lichens and mosses was not high, it varied significantly according to lowbush blueberry age. It was higher in 5-7-year old plantations with no significant differences with a natural, drained bog. As plant cover by cultivated blueberry plants increased up to 99% in the 13-year plantation, the presence of non-vascular plants diminished. The total number of arthropods depended on the age of the blueberry plantation and was lowest in the non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Plantation age influenced arthropod abundance in both experimental years. More beneficial or neutral arthropods were found in bog and 6- and 7-year old plantations, while phytophagous arthropods predominated in older plots. Dominating beneficial arthropod groups in both years were Araneidae, Thomisidae, Lycosidae, Collembola, Formicidae and Carabidae. The growing of lowbush blueberry may become one option for the vegetation restoration of abandoned peatlands and the plant cover it provides serves as a suitable habitat for various arthropods.

This currently impedes our ability to predict the responses of communities to the ongoing global changes in these major world's biodiversity reservoirs. Here, we focus on the Sierra Nevada mountain range, a core region of the Baetic-Rifan biodiversity hotspot in the western Mediterranean, and explore the relative importance of soil properties and elevation in shaping phylogenetic and functional diversity of shrub communities. We recorded the total number of each species in community transects across elevation gradients and contrasting soil conditions, and measured some ecologically relevant functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio, plant height and blooming duration). Phylogenetic distances among species were inferred from a genus-level time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. Elevation was the main factor predicting phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity of plant communities. Species in high-elevation communities were phylogenetically distant but functionally similar, being relatively smaller and having relatively short blooming durations, whilst species in low-elevation communities showed the opposite pattern. Beta diversity in SLA and leaf C:N ratio based on species incidences were positively correlated with a soil pH and micronutrient gradient. Specifically, communities that develop on soils of high pH and low micronutrient concentrations showed low SLA values and high leaf C:N ratios, whilst communities on soils of lower pH and high micronutrient concentrations showed the opposite pattern. We conclude that soil properties and elevation simultaneously shape the structure of Mediterranean shrub communities by differentially acting on the different dimensions of the species niches. Elevation seems to filter plant height and phenology-related traits whereas nutrient-related functional traits are more related to soil properties. Our study illustrates the primary role of environmental heterogeneity for the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean mountain ecosystems.

One site upstream and three sites downstream from the inlet of a communal waste water treatment plant (WWTP) were analyzed during 1996/ 97. In total, 67 diatom species were detected and the relative abundance of each taxon determined. The Shannon Diversity Index and the Saprobic Index were calculated and related to the newly developed Swiss Trophic Diatom Index. Dominant species belonged to the genera Achnanthes, Amphora, Cymbella, Diatoma, Gomphonema, Navicula, and Nitzschia. The species composition and the abundance of the diatom species present varied over the seasons, but changes in the chemical parameters or the flow regime had little effect. The Shannon Index gave evidence of biodiversity variations over the seasons and some differences between sampling sites. The Saprobic Index oscillated within a small band, indicative for oligo-mesosaprobic conditions. It could not identify significant changes in water quality between sampling sites and over the seasons. The Swiss Trophic Diatom Index differentiated better between sampling sites and seasons and gave values corresponding to a beta-mesosaprobic state. Preliminary data from 2005 and 2006 give no evidence of a change in water quality during the last decade.

Here we revise 19 growth form descriptions and use an independent expert process to allocate the most common (primary) growth form to the native terrestrial vascular plant flora of NSW. Independent allocations made by three botanists concurred for 6,153 taxa (84.7 per cent of the flora) and the remaining 1,112 taxa were resolved via a structured consensus making process. Allocation of each taxon to primary growth form has generated a single point of reference for the most common growth form for each native vascular plant species, expressed in its mature state across the extent of its range in NSW. The work presented here was undertaken to support transparent, repeatable and rigorous assessments of the richness and cover of growth form groups for the NSW Biodiversity Assessment Method. However, our approach and findings will be relevant to any government agency, industry group or researcher that uses plant growth forms to simplify ecological complexity or to assess the site-scale biodiversity values of terrestrial vegetation.

We investigate this possibility using the most extensive available dataset on species distributions in Europe, providing data for 3143 species. Observed land uses were utilised to generate three indicators of anthropogenic 'pressure' for 1971-2000: urbanisation, cropland and grassland use intensities. Storylines describing alternative development pathways were used to create four land-use scenarios for 2021-2050. Exposure of biodiversity to human activities was measured as changes in the degree of pressure recorded in hypothetical reserve networks selected to maximize the representation of plant, breeding bird, mammal, amphibian, and reptile species. In all socio-economic scenarios there was a tendency for increasing urbanisation and decreasing cropland intensities within selected conservation areas. Pressures arising from increasing grassland use were variable across scenarios and taxa. Our results challenge the idea that a single development strategy might provide reduced impacts in all regions and taxonomic groups. We show that impacts are likely to be complex and that tradeoffs might exist among development strategies. Nevertheless, results are contingent on the data, scale, and type of analyses conducted and further research is required to assess the impacts of alternative human-development scenarios.

This is partially explained by the mismatch between those who bear the costs of and those who benefit from conservation. While local actors, private and public, face management and opportunity costs due to conservation policies, the benefits reach beyond local borders. In this paper, we argue that a successful biodiversity conservation policy mix should include economic instruments directed at public and private local stakeholders. These instruments should be mutually reinforcing and target decision processes regarding land-use zoning and land management practices. To illustrate our argument, we focus on European agri-environmental measures (directed at private landowners) and ecological fiscal transfers (for local governments). We describe each of these instruments and derive main lessons from their implementation. Finally, we present proposals for linking them to reinforce their individual contributions to the overall goal of halting biodiversity loss, taking the Portuguese case as an example.

Where Crepidula was present, no species dominated and abundance remained low At the site without Crepidula, abundance was higher and the mysid Haplostylus lobatus dominated the suprabenthic community. Swimming activity of most suprabenthic species was increased by the presence of C. fornicata. The differential abundance and swimming activity of certain species are linked to the conversion of the formerly soft substrate to now hard, shelled substrate.

The discharge is attributed to high rates of erosion in the Lake's catchment, principally occurring on agricultural land. This study examines how survival strategies, such as expansion of cultivated farmland and use of low fertilizer application rates, enhance the likelihood of erosion in the Linthipe River Catchment - one of the Lake's important river catchments. As such, it shows that the magnitude of erosion is significantly correlated to the amount of farmland cultivated by estate farmers and smallholders (r = 0.18, P = 0.03, and r = 0.19, P = 0.003 respectively). The low correlation coefficients uphold the long-established fact that physical variables such as soil erodibility (vulnerability of soil to erosion), rainfall erosivity (the potential of rainfall to cause erosion), and topography, also play major roles in erosion processes. Nonetheless they do show that area of cultivated land contributes to erosion. Additionally, the study shows that yields of important crops such as maize and tobacco are low because of insufficient use of fertilizers. To compensate for the low yields, farmers rely on extending sizes of land that they cultivate thereby exposing more land to erosive forces of rainfall. The study, therefore, concludes that Lake Malawi's biodiversity is under threat. In order to sustain the biodiversity, it is necessary to eliminate the need to increase farmland by means of agricultural intensification that incorporates appropriate soil-conservation measures.

The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) are a clear example of both endemicity and diversity, and are considered a key taxon to study and monitor biogeographic and biodiversity patterns. This is the first review that compiles data about abundance and diversity of Iberian pycnogonids and examines their biogeographic patterns and bathymetric constraints using GIS tools. A total of 17762 pycnogonid records from 343 localities were analyzed and were found to contain 65 species, 21 genera and 12 families. Achelia echinata and Ammothella longipes (family Acheliidae) were the most abundant comprising similar to 80% of the total records. The Acheliidae is also the most speciose in Iberian waters with 15 species. In contrast, the family Nymphonidae has 7 species but is significantly less abundant (<1% of the total records) than Acheliidae. Species accumulation curves indicate that further sampling would increase the number of Iberian species records. Current sampling effort suggests that the pycnogonid fauna of the Mediterranean region may be richer than that of the Atlantic. The Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea are recognized as species-rich areas that act as buffer zones between the Atlantic and Mediterranean boundaries. The deep waters surrounding the Iberian Peninsula are poorly surveyed, with only 15% of the sampling sites located below 1000 m. Further deep-water sampling is needed mainly on the Iberian Mediterranean side.

Almost inevitably, this demand for information has led to demand for a broad-scale monitoring system. However the decision to embark on a monitoring system should only be made once it has been established that a monitoring system is the optimal way to inform management. We stress the need to invest resources in assessing whether a monitoring system is necessary before committing resources to the design and implementation of the system. Current debate associated with the design of a biodiversity monitoring system has similarities to the debate within the range management profession in the early 1970s. The experience with range monitoring shows that large-scale monitoring systems such as those being proposed will require considerable resources, recurrently expended into the distant future, but with only a limited ability to adapt to new demands. Those involved in any biodiversity monitoring system will need to understand the implications of investing in a long-term monitoring programme. Monitoring sustainability will only be possible if the monitoring system is itself sustainable. We discuss a number of issues that need to be addressed before the system is at all sustainable. These attributes are a mix of biophysical, social and institutional attributes and highlight the view that monitoring systems of the type being suggested comprise an unusual mixture of attributes not found in typical scientific activity. The present paper is not a technical manual, but rather considers some of the design issues associated with designing and implementing large-scale monitoring systems.

These two factors, reported as the main drivers of land-snail assemblage diversity, are also among the main habitat characteristics of calcareous seepages. Here we explore local species richness and compositional variation of forest spring-fed patches (i.e. seepages), to test the hypothesis that these habitats might act as biodiversity hotspots and refugia of regional snail faunas. In contrast to treeless spring fens, only little is known about land snail faunas inhabiting forest seepages. Studying 25 isolated calcareous forest seepages, evenly distributed across the White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area (SE Czech Republic), we found that these sites, albeit spatially very limited, can harbour up to 66% of the shelled land-snail species known to occur in this well-explored protected area (in total 83 species). By comparing land snail assemblages of the studied seepages with those occurring in the woodland surroundings of each site as well as those previously sampled in 28 preserved forest sites within the study area, we found the seepages to be among the most species rich sites. Although the numbers of species did not statistically differ among these three systems, we found highly significant differences in species composition. Seepage faunas were composed of many species significantly associated with spring sites, in contrast to the assemblages of both surrounding and preserved forest sites. Our results highly support the hypothesis that calcareous forest seepages might serve as refugia and biodiversity hotspots of regional land snail faunas. Protection of these unique habitats challenges both conservation plans and forest management guidelines as they might act as sources for the recolonization and restoration of forest snail assemblages particularly in areas impoverished by harvesting and clearcutting.

This has led conservationists to consider whether sacred groves could be used for in situ conservation. Eight sacred groves of the Ugunda chieftaincy of the Wanyamwezi in central Tanzania representing burial sites that varied from 6-300 years old were inventoried to compare woody species richness and taxonomic diversity with those of forest plots in a state managed Forest Reserve. Although they occupied a relatively small area the sacred groves had greater woody species richness and taxonomic diversity than the state managed Forest Reserve. The forest plots and the groves shared a species similarity index of 45%, suggesting that the sacred groves contributed to in situ conservation of the miombo woodland biodiversity. Some of the woody species were absent in the forest plots, also suggesting that groves served as a refuge for some species. An inventory of all existing sacred groves could provide important information on their role in in situ conservation. In order to promote them for community-based conservation of biodiversity the government should declare sacred groves as preservation sites, and incorporate them into modern conservation systems.

They safeguard some of the best examples of unfragmented natural landscapes in many regions, provide important habitat for rare and threatened species, and serve as a refuge from a human-dominated world. As climates continue to change, species distributions, ecological communities, and ecosystems will be altered. An understanding of the trends in these changes can allow protected area managers to develop more effective climate-adaptation strategies. Here, we quantify the relative amount of projected potential climate-driven ecological change across a protected area network by calculating three metrics. We assessed future projected changes in temperature and precipitation, shifts in major vegetation types, and vertebrate species turnover for the protected areas of the Pacific Northwestern region of North America. In general, the degree of projected change in the three metrics followed a longitudinal gradient from the Pacific coast inland toward the continental interior. Protected areas expected to experience the least change are at low elevations near the coast and throughout the Coastal Mountains, whereas areas expected to experience the most change are found at higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin regions. The resulting spatial variation in these impact measures underscores the importance of developing appropriate, location-specific, climate-adaptation strategies in response to disparate trends in future environmental change.

The neutral model of biodiversity is a simple model that appears to provide parsimonious and accurate predictions of biodiversity patterns in some ecosystems, even though it ignores processes such as species interactions and niche structure. In a recent paper, we used analytical techniques to reveal why the mean predictions of the neutral model are robust to niche structure in high diversity but not low-diversity ecosystems. In the present paper, we explore this phenomenon further by generating stochastic simulated data from a spatially implicit hybrid niche-neutral model across different speciation rates. We compare the resulting patterns of species richness and abundance with the patterns expected from a pure neutral and a pure niche model. As the speciation rate in the hybrid model increases, we observe a surprisingly rapid transition from an ecosystem in which diversity is almost entirely governed by niche structure to one in which diversity is statistically indistinguishable from that of the neutral model. Because the transition is rapid, one prediction of our abstract model is that high-diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests can be approximated by one simple model-the neutral model-whereas low-diversity ecosystems such as temperate forests can be approximated by another simple model-the niche model. Ecosystems that require the hybrid model are predicted to be rare, occurring only over a narrow range of speciation rates.

These factors are, however, most frequently investigated separately, ignoring the potential for synergistic effects of biodiversity loss and environmental warming on ecosystem functioning. Here we use high-throughput experiments with microbial communities to investigate how changes in temperature affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We found that changes in temperature systematically altered the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. As temperatures departed from ambient conditions the exponent of the diversity-functioning relationship increased, meaning that more species were required to maintain ecosystem functioning under thermal stress. This key result was driven by two processes linked to variability in the thermal tolerance curves of taxa. First, more diverse communities had a greater chance of including species with thermal traits that enabled them to maintain productivity as temperatures shifted from ambient conditions. Second, we found a pronounced increase in the contribution of complementarity to the net biodiversity effect at high and low temperatures, indicating that changes in species interactions played a critical role in mediating the impacts of temperature change on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that if biodiversity loss occurs independently of species' thermal tolerance traits, then the additional impacts of environmental warming will result in sharp declines in ecosystem function.

However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e. local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.

A set of experimental gill nets comprising nine multifilament nets of stretched meshes 25.4 mm, 38.1,50.8, 63.5, 76.2, 88.9, 101.6, 127.0 and 177.8 mm were used to sample the shore, surface and bottom water habitats of the reservoir. Seven species of fish belonging to five families were recorded. The most dominant fish family by number was Cichlidae, with two species Tilapia zillii (17.95 +/- 4.43) and Chromidotilapia guntheri guntheri (4.91 +/- 1.47) followed by Characidae with species Alestes macrolopidotus (2.11 +/- 0.45), Mochokidae family with Synodontis vermiculatus (1.63 +/- 0.27), Claridae with two species Clarias anguillarias (0.60 +/- 0.11) and Clarias albopunctatus (0.75 +/- 0.25), and, Family Hepsetidae with species Hepsetus odoe (1.16 +/- 0.30). Bottom water habitat shows the presence of all the fish families with their species, while the shore and surface water habitat harbour species Tilapia zilli and Chromidotilapia guntheri guntheri of family Cichlidae, Synodontis vermiculatus of family Mochokidae and Alestes macrolopidotus of family Characidae. The study revealed that species Hepsetus odoe of family Hepsetidae, and species Clarias anguillarias and Clarias albopunctatus of family Claridae were only present in the bottom water habitat of Tagwai reservoir. Kwata Bello sampling station recorded the highest population (15.18 +/- 1.56) of fish catch during the sampling period, while the least catch of fish population (3.18 +/- 0.32) was recorded at Kwata Birgi sampling station. The family Cichlidae with population (22.86 +/- 2.86) has the highest distribution in the reservoir. This indicates that Tagwai reservoir has therefore become unique compared to most other tropical man-made lakes and reservoirs in Africa, where Cichlids dominate the fishery soon after impoundment.

This paper departs from this approach by concentrating not on the measurement of total economic costs and benefits from protected areas but on their distribution, Protected area benefits and costs are discussed at three separate spatial scales: local, national/regional, and global/transnational. The overall picture shows that economic benefits-although difficult to measure and varying from site to site-are limited on a local scale, increase somewhat on a regional/national level and then become potentially substantial on a transnational/global scale. The economic costs follow an opposite trend, from being locally significant, regionally and nationally moderate, and globally small. It is evident that there are few local incentives and very limited regional and national incentives for protected area establishment and management in developing countries. Very little, if any, empirical work has been done on the distribution of protected area costs and benefits. The conclusion of this paper is that such analysis can provide an essential bridge between economic valuation studies and the identification of necessary and practical action steps.

Such climate mediated changes in species distribution patterns have the potential to profoundly alter temperate communities, as this advance can serve to push temperate taxa, many of which are southern Australian endemics, southward. These changes can lead to cascading effects for the biodiversity and function of coastal ecosystems, including contraction of ranges/habitats of sensitive cool water species. Hence there is growing concern for the future of Australia's temperate marine biodiversity. Here we examine the diversity and abundance of marine flora and fauna at two reefs near Perth's metropolitan areaMinden Reef and Roe Reef. We report the presence of 427 species of marine flora and fauna from eight taxon groups occurring in the Perth metropolitan area; at least three species of which appear to be new to science. Our data also extends the known range of 15 species, and in numerous instances, thousands of kilometres south from the Kimberley or Pilbara and verifies that tropicalisation of reef communities in the Perth metropolitan area is occurring. We report the presence of 24 species endemic to south-west Australia that may be at risk of range contractions with continued ocean warming. The results of these surveys add to our knowledge of local nearshore marine environments in the Perth metropolitan area and support the growing body of evidence that indicates a diverse and regionally significant marine fauna occurs in temperate Western Australia. Regular, repeated survey work across seasons is important in order to thoroughly document the status of marine biodiversity in this significant transition zone.

However, in the real world many trade-offs are involved in the selection of an indicator group, and a single group rarely satisfies all criteria. We investigated cross-taxon congruence of assemblage composition patterns using both quantitative and qualitative data between adult dragonflies and aquatic insects (midges, Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT), beetles and entire aquatic insects assemblage). Also, we tested whether environmental and spatial variables were important drivers for cross-taxon congruence. Finally, we developed a set of guiding criteria that avoid arbitrariness in the selection of the best indicator group. We sampled adult dragonflies and aquatic insects in 41 streams and rivers along a riparian vegetation loss gradient in a Neotropical riverine network. We used Procrustes analyses to verify surrogacy between groups and the association of each group with environmental and spatial predictors. The criteria used involves both operational and performance aspects to select an indicator group. Our results showed that adult dragonflies were weakly congruent with the entire aquatic insects assemblage and aquatic insect subgroups were moderate (beetles) to strongly (EPT and midges) congruent with the entire assemblage. Comparisons between EPT, midges and beetles were also weakly congruent, with the exception of midges-EPT. The association between assemblage patterns and overall environmental predictors was significant for all groups, while with spatial patterns, only midges and entire assemblage showed significant results. Numerical resolution slightly improved the congruence results. Incidence data could be used instead of abundance, due to higher congruence values compared to abundance data. Based on cost-benefit, EPT was selected as the best indicator group for monitoring the effects of riparian vegetation loss on aquatic biodiversity, and its use could be viable in biomonitoring programs.

However, due to their inconspicuous and largely subterranean nature, they are usually neglected in biodiversity inventories. The goal of this study was to identify the key determinants of fungal richness, community composition, and turnover in tropical rainforests. We tested specifically for the effect of soil properties, habitat, and locality in Amazonia. For these analyses, we used high-throughput sequencing data of short and long reads of fungal DNA present in soil and organic litter samples, combining existing and novel genomic data. Habitat type (phytophysiognomy) emerges as the strongest factor explaining fungal community composition. Naturally open areas-campinas-are the richest habitat overall. Soil properties have different effects depending on the soil layer (litter or mineral soil) and the choice of genetic marker. We suggest that campinas could be a neglected hotspot of fungal diversity. An underlying cause for their rich diversity may be the overall low soil fertility, which increases the reliance on biotic interactions essential for nutrient absorption in these environments, notably ectomycorrhizal fungi-plant associations. Our results highlight the advantages of using both short and long DNA reads produced through high-throughput sequencing to characterize fungal diversity. While short reads can suffice for diversity and community comparison, long reads add taxonomic precision and have the potential to reveal population diversity.

Using a newly developed set of reptile-specific primers for COI we present the first comprehensive study targeting the entire reptile fauna of the fourth-largest island in the world, the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar. Methodology/Principal Findings: Representatives of the majority of Madagascan non-avian reptile species (including Squamata and Testudines) were sampled and successfully DNA barcoded. The new primer pair achieved a constantly high success rate (72.7-100%) for most squamates. More than 250 species of reptiles (out of the 393 described ones; representing around 64% of the known diversity of species) were barcoded. The average interspecific genetic distance within families ranged from a low of 13.4% in the Boidae to a high of 29.8% in the Gekkonidae. Using the average genetic divergence between sister species as a threshold, 41-48 new candidate (undescribed) species were identified. Simulations were used to evaluate the performance of DNA barcoding as a function of completeness of taxon sampling and fragment length. Compared with available multi-gene phylogenies, DNA barcoding correctly assigned most samples to species, genus and family with high confidence and the analysis of fewer taxa resulted in an increased number of well supported lineages. Shorter marker-lengths generally decreased the number of well supported nodes, but even mini-barcodes of 100 bp correctly assigned many samples to genus and family. Conclusions/Significance: The new protocols might help to promote DNA barcoding of reptiles and the established library of reference DNA barcodes will facilitate the molecular identification of Madagascan reptiles. Our results might be useful to easily recognize undescribed diversity (i.e. novel taxa), to resolve taxonomic problems, and to monitor the international pet trade without specialized expert knowledge.

The number of taxa per station varied from 75 to 171, the density from 1790 to 8723 individuals m(-2), and the faunal diversity (Shannon-Wiener H') from 4.4 to 6.4. In general, the number of taxa increased with depth, whereas the highest densities were recorded at 10 and 25 in. The species richness was generally high at both small (alpha diversity) and larger (gamma diversity) spatial scales compared with other northern and off-shore shelf areas. Species turnover (beta diversity) was,greater across depths within fjords than within depths across fjords. Species community patterns were related to depth and sediment grain size. Statistical analyses undertaken indicated that the juveniles did not affect community structure very Much. Among the polychaetes and molluscs the proportion Of surface deposit feeders - inclusive of the both surface-feeding and suspensivorous Spionidae and Oweniidae - and the deep Subsurface deposit feeders (Maldanidae and the capitellid Heteromastus filiformis) largely increased with depth. The lowest proportion of other subsurface deposit feeders and the suspensivores occurred at the deepest stations. The study may provide useful reference data for sub-Arctic fjord enviroinments.

Extensive collections were performed throughout the estuary in five sampling campaigns during the summer and winter periods of 2012 and 2013 and summer of 2014, totalling 185 samples. About 49,000 organisms were analysed which together with the few previous records resulted in a total of 36 hydromedusae and three siphonophore species. We highlight the presence of Cnidostoma fallax in high abundance (>19,000 individuals captured; similar to 0% of all planktonic hydrozoans). The high abundance of this species throughout three consecutive summers suggests a change in the local assemblage structure, since previous reports in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s had shown Liriope tetraphylla recurrently as the dominant species which now ranks fourth. It is difficult to ascertain the causes of such changes due to the paucity of previous studies on Brazilian estuaries, but one possibility is that C. fallax has been recently introduced. In any case, the high dominance of this hydromedusa was not expected and this scenario would potentially cause changes in the local food web since C. fallax and L. tetraphylla are quite different morphologically and ecologically and thus probably play different trophic roles. Future studies are necessary to check the long-term permanency of C. fallax and to assess its biology and ecology and the impact of this assemblage change on the ecosystem.

Samples were collected along the Brazilian continental margin between 18 degrees S and 23 degrees S, at 37 stations with depths from 20 m to 1,330 m. The analysis of the biogeographic distribution patterns confirmed the existence of a transitional zone from tropical to subtropical waters in the area of both the continental shelf and slope, suggesting a relationship with water mass circulation. We observed a high species turnover rate between the shelf and slope. The analysis of gastropod species distribution revealed a similar pattern on the shelf and slope and a large difference between shallow and deep-water faunas.

We suggest a methodology to derive a general relationship between biodiversity change and global warming. In conjunction with other pressure relationships, our relationship can help to assess the combined effect of different pressures to overall biodiversity change and indicate areas that are most at risk. We use a combination of an integrated environmental model ( IMAGE) and climate envelope models for European plant species for several climate change scenarios to estimate changes in mean stable area of species and species turnover. We show that if global temperature increases, then both species turnover will increase, and mean stable area of species will decrease in all biomes. The most dramatic changes will occur in Northern Europe, where more than 35% of the species composition in 2100 will be new for that region, and in Southern Europe, where up to 25% of the species now present will have disappeared under the climatic circumstances forecasted for 2100. In Mediterranean scrubland and natural grassland/steppe systems, arctic and tundra systems species turnover is high, indicating major changes in species composition in these ecosystems. The mean stable area of species decreases mostly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland/steppe systems and warm mixed forests.

However, over the last two decades harvesting of mangrove forests has been extensive with effects on mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. We investigate the effect of mangrove harvesting on tree biodiversity in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using two line transects each in ten mangrove forests, mangrove composition, species dominance, density, frequency, coverage, and stem diameter and diversity were recorded. Interviews detailing provisioning ecosystem services were also conducted with local forestry and fishery workers to determine the level of exploitation. Ten mangrove species were recorded (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba) belonging to six families (Avicenniaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Combretaceae, Arecaceae and Sonneratiaceae). Mangrove forests are now dominated by saplings and seedlings, with few trees above 15 cm diameter at breast height. Rhizophora sp. were found to be the most important and dominant species. Rhizophora sp. was the most widely used as it was deemed the most suitable for firewood and charcoal. In addition, it is the main species planted in mangrove restoration projects, which have focused on establishing production forest rather than restoring natural species composition and structure. Despite the decrease in biodiversity, the mangroves still provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the communities in the area.

Agricultural changes have been identified as a main driver of these declines. Although different agrienvironmental schemes have been implemented, their positive effect on biodiversity is relatively unknown. This raises the question as to how to reconcile farming production and biodiversity conservation to operationalize a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. We devised a bioeconomic model and conducted an analysis based on coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture. The coviability approach extended population viability analyses by including bioeconomic risk. Our model coupled stochastic dynamics of both biodiversity and farming land-uses selected at the microlevel with public policies at the macrolevel on the basis of financial incentives (taxes or subsidies) for land uses. The coviability approach made it possible for us to evaluate bioeconomic risks of these public incentives through the probability of satisfying a mix of biodiversity and economic constraints over time. We calibrated the model and applied it to a community of 34 common birds in metropolitan France at the small agricultural regions scale. We identified different public policies and scenarios with tolerable (0-0%) agroecological risk and modeled their outcomes up to 2050. Budgetary, economic, and ecological (based on Farmland Bird Index) constraints were essential to understanding the set of viable public policies. Our results suggest that some combinations of taxes on cereals and subsidies on grasslands could be relevant to develop a multifunctional agriculture. Moreover, the flexibility and multicriteria viewpoint underlying the coviability approach may help in the implementation of adaptive management.

We developed indices based on regression models between, grass, shrub, litter, exposed-soil groundcover components and Landsat thematic mapper satellite imagery reflectance values over a reference site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico. This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil. Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down, litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape, grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil, grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not. Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity conservation value.

""Biodiversity prospecting'' - the search among naturally occurring organisms for new products of agricultural, industrial, and, particularly, pharmaceutical value - has been advanced as both a mechanism and a motive for conserving biological diversity. Economists and others have attempted to estimate the value of biodiversity for use in new pharmaceutical project research. In this paper we apply a new approach to estimating values: we employ two models of competition among differentiated products. Each model confirms previous findings that the value to private researchers of the ""marginal species'' is likely to be small. The models can have very different implications with respect to social values, however. These findings underscore the need for a better understanding of the true meaning of diversity."

Ecological Engineering	01/05/2017	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.02.062	10	"Wildflowers Wildflowers have an important environmental impact on rural biodiversity. Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the ""greening"" measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation.

In addition, topography is a complex factor, and the relationship between topography and biodiversity is still poorly understood. To understand the role of topography, i.e., altitude and slope, in biodiversity, we selected Jinggangshan Mountain (JGM), an area with unique topography, as the study area. We surveyed plant and animal species richness of JGM and compared the biodiversity and the main geographic characteristics of JGM with the adjacent 4 mountains. Gleason's richness index was calculated to assess the diversity of species. In total, 2958 spermatophyte species, 418 bryophyte species, 355 pteridophyte species and 493 species of vertebrate animals were recorded in this survey. In general, the JGM biodiversity was higher than that of the adjacent mountains. Regarding topographic characteristics, 77% of JGM's area was in the mid-altitude region and approximately 40% of JGM's area was in the 10 degrees-20 degrees slope range, which may support more vegetation types in JGM area and make it a biodiversity hotspot. It should be noted that although the impact of topography on biodiversity was substantial, climate is still a more general factor driving the formation and maintenance of higher biodiversity. Topographic conditions can create microclimates, and both climatic and topographic conditions contribute to the formation of high biodiversity in JGM.

Three broad groups of indicators are defined: (1) resource use indicators representing pressures on the environment; (2) resource efficiency indicators relating resource use indicators to the socio-economic side; and (3) environmental impact indicators linking resource use impacts on the state of the natural system. Based on this conceptual framework we develop a structure for possible resource efficiency indicators and conduct a RACER evaluation on the Relevance, Acceptance, Credibility, Easiness and Robustness of indicators. With the RACER evaluation, we identify areas where indicators are well established and available as well as areas where indicators still need further development or even need to be designed first.

Small islands hold a disproportionately large amount of the worlds threatened biodiversity but it is among the least well-documented. This paper reports on the most extensive collation and synthesis of biodiversity data to date for the 14 United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs). A process of literature review and consultation produced 65,259 species records, including 32,216 native species of which 1549 were endemic to a single UKOT. The extent of knowledge of species occurrence varied both between islands and taxonomic groups. It was higher for vertebrates and vascular plants than small bodied invertebrates and non-vascular and for non-Caribbean compared to Caribbean islands, a difference that largely reflects knowledge of invertebrates. Global Red List assessments exist for 2606 species and document 111 of endemic species, 75 % of those assessed, and 291, 12 % of non-endemics, as globally threatened. Using the data to estimate true species richness suggests a further 70,000 native species, including 1800 single island endemics, remain to be documented suggesting the UKOTs as a whole may support over 100,000 native species including 3300 single island endemics.

This work aims to fill in this knowledge gap by exploring the modelling potential of nine Baltic Sea ecosystem models to support this specific European policy and, in particular, models' capabilities to inform on marine biodiversity. Several links are found between the Model-Derived Indicators and some of the relevant biodiversity-related descriptors (i.e. biological diversity and food webs), and pressures (i.e. interference with hydrological processes, nutrient and organic matter enrichment and marine acidification). However several gaps remain, in particular in the limited representation of habitats other than the pelagic that the models are able to address for descriptor sea-floor integrity and inability to assess descriptor non-indigenous species. The general outcome is that the Baltic Sea models considered do not adequately cover all the requested needs of the MSFD, but can potentially do so to a certain extent, while for some descriptors/criteria/indicators/pressures new indicators and/or modelling techniques need to be developed in order to satisfactorily address the requirement of the MSFD and assess the environmental status of the Baltic Sea.

Species richness in the sweep net samples was low in 2 lakes with recent ecological perturbations and the highest in one oligotrophic lake. Species diversity was the lowest in 2 eutrophicated lakes and generally higher in the oligotrophic lakes. The biodiversity values in sediment assemblages showed trends similar to those in the sweep net samples; the lowest values were observed in one of the eutrophic lakes and the highest in the oligotrophic lakes. It is likely that the observed differences were due to the impact of nutrients on the development of littoral vegetation and consequently chydorid habitats and resources. The role of nutrients as a forcing mechanism on chydorid biodiversity was indicated by high and significant negative correlations between species diversity in both total phosphorus and sweep net and sediment samples. The comparison between biodiversity in the 2 sample types showed that the biodiversity values were almost consistently higher in the surface sediment assemblages than in the sweep net samples, suggesting that surface sediment analysis provides an effective alternative method to living material examination for biodiversity evaluations.

Argentine ant invasions can also exert other effects on the community through interactions with plants and their associated arthropods. For example, carbohydrate resources (e.g. floral or extrafloral nectar) may influence foraging behaviour and interactions among ants and other arthropods. In South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, Argentine ants and some native ant species are attracted to the floral nectar of Leucospermum conocarpodendron Rourke (Proteaceae), a native tree that also has extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited inflorescences more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging was influenced by the EFNs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to inflorescences with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to ant-excluded inflorescences. Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75% less time foraging on inflorescences with Argentine ants than on inflorescences without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to inflorescences had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen-limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the inflorescences, but did not differ among inflorescences visited by native and Argentine ants. Displacement of arthropods appears to be a consistent consequence of Argentine ant invasions. The displacement of floral arthropods by Argentine ants may have far-reaching consequences for this biodiversity hotspot and other regions that are rich in insect-pollinated plants.

Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30 degrees 41' N; 90 degrees 29' W), eastern Louisiana (USA). Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m(2) plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades. Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m(2), 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and short-lived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition. Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species.

The model revealed an important influence of seasonally anomalous weather on fire probability, with increased probability of fire in seasons that are warmer and drier than average. In addition to these local-scale influences, the Antarctic Ocean Oscillation (AAO) was identified as an important large-scale influence or teleconnection to global circulation patterns. Fire probability increased in seasons during positive AAO phases, when the subtropical jet moves northward and low level moisture transport decreases. These results confirm that fire occurrence in the CFR is strongly affected by climatic variability at both local and global scales, and thus likely to respond sensitively to future climate change. Comparison of the modelled fire probability between two periods (1951-1975 and 1976-2000) revealed a 4-year decrease in an average fire return time. If, as currently forecasted, climate change in the region continues to produce higher temperatures, more frequent heat waves, and/or lower rainfall, our model thus indicates that fire frequency is likely to increase substantially. The regional implications of shorter fire return times include shifting community structure and composition, favoring species that tolerate more frequent fires. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, data about their abundance and diversity, and information about the criteria used for the species selection, are still limited. Besides providing a historical overview, we analyze and compare data on abundance, diversity and criteria of species selection of street trees in 15 Italian cities chosen considering their representativeness along a bioclimatic transect across Italy. The biodiversity of urban street trees resulted quite rich with 277 species (about 60% are exotic); among these, Platanus x hispanica Mill. ex Munchh., Celtis australis L. and Quercus ilex L. resulted as the most common species. Besides the general suitability for the local climatic conditions, several factors seem to concur in the species selection, such as their aesthetic appeal and dimension. Other selection criteria based on the species' ecology or functionality were not evident.

Economic forces are recognized as an important driving factor behind current biodiversity losses. This study investigates whether such factors have been important in determining one measure of biodiversity change over the 'long run' - in our case, 400 years - for upland sites in Scotland. 2. A combination of palaeoecological, historical and economic methods is used to construct and then analyse a database of factors contributing to changes in plant diversity over time for 11 upland sites. 3. Using an instrumental variables panel model, we find livestock prices, our proxy for grazing pressure, to be a statistically significant determinant of diversity change, with higher grazing pressures resulting in lower diversity values on average, although site abandonment is also found to result in a fall in plant diversity. Technological change, such as the introduction of new animal breeds, was not found to be a statistically significant determinant. 4. Using later period data (post 1860) on livestock numbers at the parish (local) level, we were able to confirm the main result noted above (3) in terms of the effects of higher grazing pressures on plant diversity. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how data from very different disciplines can be combined to address questions relevant to contemporary conservation and understanding. This novel, interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the role of economic factors as a driver of biodiversity loss in the uplands. Biodiversity levels have varied considerably over 400 years, partly as a function of land management, suggesting that establishing baselines or 'natural' target levels for biodiversity is likely to be problematic. Changes in livestock grazing pressures brought about by changes in prices had statistically significant effects on estimated plant diversity, as did land abandonment. This suggests that long-term management of upland areas for the conservation of diversity should focus on grazing pressures as a key policy attribute. Another policy implication is that drastic cuts in grazing pressures - such as might occur under current reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy - can have adverse biodiversity consequences.

The Moor Cliffs Formation contains several fine-grained tuff horizons that act as regional markers for correlation, three of these are substantial in thickness (0.5-4 m), laterally persistent and contain abundant trace fossils. The tuffs record sudden volcanic events associated with the convergence of Avalonia with Laurentia, possibly accompanied by tsunami. The trace fossils preserved on the tops of individual falls include the locally profuse development of ovoid faecal pellets in close association with the tops of trumpet-shaped burrows. Surfaces also preserve arthropod locomotion and foraging traces (Palmichnium antarcticum, Diplopodichnus biformis, rare Cruziana sp., and bilobed trails). Vertical and horizontal burrows (Beaconites antarcticus) are common. Other traces found are microbially generated wrinkle marks (mat grounds) and ""cauliflower"" structures. Traces in the tuffs record a greater diversity of faunal activity than that observed in the encasing dryland environment sediments and indicate a possible preservational bias provided by deposition of the air fall tuffs or colonization of the tuff deposits by opportunist populations following phytoplankton blooms associated with the volcanic events. They remain the main indicators of biodiversity in this relatively fossil-poor continental stratigraphic interval. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This is overall true when considering global scales, since human-induced global change is expected to make significant changes on the Earth's biota. Biodiversity management and planning is mainly based on field observations related to community diversity, considering different taxa. However, such methods are time and cost demanding and do not allow in most cases to get temporal replicates. In this view, remote sensing can provide a wide data coverage in a short period of time. Recently, the use of Rao's Q diversity as a measure of spectral diversity has been proposed in order to explicitly take into account differences in a neighbourhood considering abundance and relative distance among pixels. The aim of this paper was to extend such a measure over the temporal dimension and to present an innovative approach to calculate remotely sensed temporal diversity. We demonstrated that temporal beta-diversity (spectral turnover) can be calculated pixel-wise in terms of both slope and coefficient of variation and further plotted over the whole matrix / image. From an ecological and operational point of view, for prioritisation practices in biodiversity protection, temporal variability could be beneficial in order to plan more efficient conservation practices starting from spectral diversity hotspots in space and time. In this paper, we delivered a highly reproducible approach to calculate spatio-temporal diversity in a robust and straightforward manner. Since it is based on open source code, we expect that our method will be further used by several researchers and landscape managers.

A framework for studying their interdependence is proposed. We argue that a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for making a transition to a truly sustainable economy is that biodiversity conservation and its analysis take into account unwanted and avoidable indirect - i.e. rebound effects of all kinds of biodiversity policy. We identify five types of such rebound effects and propose the terms biodiversity (two types), ecological, service and environmental rebound for these. The service rebound is associated with the problem of incongruence or conflicts, and thus the potential need for trade-offs, between ecosystem services or between such services and biodiversity conservation. Effective biodiversity policy requires the minimization of these various rebound effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.	Maestre Andres, Sara ; Calvet Mir, Laura ; van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

The feeding rate of R. venosa on native mussels was estimated in a laboratory experiment. A flume with a constant water flow was used, in which the mean (+/- SD) temperature was 25.4 +/- 1.8 degrees C, the mean (+/- SD) salinity was 18.5 +/- 1.6, and a 15:9 light-dark schedule was followed. Each experimental trial lasted 9 days and a constant prey supply was maintained. Three size classes of predators and three size classes of prey (Brachidontes rodriguezii and Mytella charruana), were used. For all sizes of predator combined, the average (+/- SD) absolute consumption rate was 0.88 +/- 0.3 g day(-1), and the relative consumption rate was 0.057 +/- 0.034 g g(-1) day(-1). No significant differences were found between the number of prey and total grams consumed among the three size categories of snails. However, for the relative consumption rate, small snails consumed significantly greater (0.10 g g(-1) day(-1)) amounts than intermediate and large snails (0.04 and 0.02 g g(-1) day(-1) respectively). All sizes of snails consumed significantly more intermediate-than small-sized mussels. This study provides important knowledge for future research to assess the impact of this invasive species on native bivalve resources.

This study aims to identify fire -smart management strategies that promote wildfire hazard reduction, climate regulation ecosystem service and biodiversity conservation. Here we simulate fire-landscape dynamics, carbon sequestration and species dis-tribution (116 vertebrates) in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Geres-Xures (NW Iberia). We envisage 11 scenarios resulting from different management strategies following four storylines: Business-as-usual (BAU), expansion of High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf), Fire-Smart forest management, and HNVf plus Fire-Smart. Fire-landscape simulations reveal an increase of up to 25% of annual burned area. HNVf areas may counter-balance this increasing fire impact, especially when combined with fire-smart strategies (reductions of up to 50% between 2031 and 2050). The Fire-Smart and BAU scenarios attain the highest estimates for total carbon se-questered. A decrease in habitat suitability (around 18%) since 1990 is predicted for species of conservation concern under the BAU scenario, while HNVf would support the best outcomes in terms of conservation. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating fire hazard control, ecosystem service supply and biodiversity con-servation to inform better decision-making in mountain landscapes of Southern Europe.

The importance of different hydrodynamic conditions along a lateral gradient was quantified for various taxonomic groups. Our results show that (i) target species require ecotopes along the entire hydrodynamic gradient; (ii) different parts of the hydrodynamic gradient are important to different species, belonging to different taxonomic groups; (iii) in particular low-dynamic parts are important for many species and (iv) species differ in their specificity for hydrodynamic conditions. Many species of higher plants, fish and butterflies have a narrow range for hydrodynamics and many species of birds and mammals use ecotopes along the entire gradient. Even when focussing only on target species, the entire natural hydrodynamic gradient is important. This means that the riverine species assemblage as a whole can benefit from measures focussing on target species only. River reconstruction and management should aim at re-establishing the entire hydrodynamic gradient, increasing the spatial heterogeneity of hydrodynamic conditions.	de Nooij, R. J. W. ; Verberk, W.

Recent developments have provided a useful framework extending existing univariate techniques into a multivariate context. Measures of taxonomic relatedness have also been introduced, which complement existing measures of diversity of assemblages. In this study, the potential effects of sewage discharge on spatial patterns of highly diverse molluscan assemblages in a Mediterranean rocky subtidal habitat were investigated. Nine 20 cmx20 cm quadrats were taken from each of three sites (80 m-100 m apart) within a putatively impacted location near a sewage outfall (I) and at each of two control locations (Cs) by destructive sampling by SCUBA divers at a depth of 3 m-4 m. A total of 5507 specimens of 151 species were collected. The average and the variance in total abundance of molluscs were greater, on average, at I than at Cs. Higher abundances at the sewage outfall were largely driven by greater numbers of juvenile molluscs. The Shannon diversity of molluscs (H') was significantly lower at I, but no difference among locations was detected for the total number of species (S). In addition, the taxonomic distinctness (Delta*) of molluscs was greater at Cs, although it was more variable at I. Multivariate analyses showed that there was a significant difference in the structure of assemblages at I compared with Cs. The location near the outfall was characterized by greater abundances of several species, including especially the gastropods Pusillina philippi, Bittium latreilli, and Bittium reticulatum. There was also greater variability in the structure of assemblages among sites and among quadrats at control locations compared to those near the outfall. Using a suite of univariate and multivariate measures, including diversity indices, detailed information on taxonomic structure and analyses of variability at different spatial scales, provided useful insights into the effects of sewage impacts on these diverse assemblages. These results also highlighted the importance of analysing measures of variance, as well as mean in considering effects of stress in natural communities.

Sixteen headline indicators have been identified for monitoring the CBD targets. Of these indicators only one, \""Trends in the abundance and distribution of selected species,\"" is a direct headline indicator of \""non-exploited\"" biodiversity. In France, the implementation of this indicator is completely dependent on data collected by volunteers. Since this investment of volunteer time is equivalent to savings in administrative costs, we attempt in this paper to assign it a monetary value. This enables us to estimate how much the French administration saves thanks to volunteer efforts and how much public funding would have to be invested if volunteers were no longer willing to participate in these biodiversity monitoring schemes. We estimate this amount to be between 678,523 and 4,415,251 euros per year, depending on the scenario selected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Although similar trends might be expected in Canada, mussels have received little attention to date. The Committee On the Statics of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) expanded its mandate in 1994 to include invertebrates, thus providing the impetus for assessing the health of Canada's freshwater mussel fauna. The purpose of this study was to determine if there have been changes over time in the richness and composition of freshwater mussel communities in the lower Great Lakes drainage basin, which historically supported the most diverse and unique mussel fauna in Canada. Over 4,100 occurrence records for 40 species of mussels collected from approximately 1,500 sites between 1860 and 1996 were compiled and examined together for the first time. Comparisons of historical and recent data revealed a pattern of species losses and changing community composition throughout the basin, particularly in the species-rich Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair drainages. River systems that once supported numerous species characteristic of a wide variety of habitats are now dominated by fewer siltation- and pollution-tolerant species of the Subfamily Anodontinae. A detailed examination of the data for the Grand, Thames, and Moira rivers confirmed that the same trends are occurring in widely-separated systems throughout the basin. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that the steady decline in freshwater mussel diversity that has been documented for the United States is also occurring in Canada.

However, conservation should clearly be proactive wherever possible. in this article, we assess the biodiversity conservation value, and specifically the irreplaceability in terms of species endemism, of those of the planet's ecosystems that remain intact. We find that 24 wilderness areas, all greater than or equal to1 million hectares, are greater than or equal to70% intact and have human densities of less than or equal to five people per km(2). This wilderness covers 44% of all land but is inhabited by only 3% of people. Given this sparse population, wilderness conservation is cost-effective, especially if ecosystem service value is incorporated. Soberingly, however, most wilderness is not speciose: only 18% of plants and 10% of terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to individual wildernesses, the majority restricted to Amazonia, Congo, New Guinea, the Miombo-Mopane woodlands, and the North American deserts. Global conservation strategy must target these five wildernesses while continuing to prioritize threatened biodiversity hotspots.

We use a stated preference choice experiment to solicit preferences for different proposed biodiversity offsets, linked to two hydropower developments in Uganda, with the aim of improving social outcomes of the offsets. We surveyed 1215 respondents from six villages located along the river impacted by the hydropower projects, Overall, people preferred offsets and compensatory activities that benefit the entire village rather than just a few individuals. People opposed the removal of non-native trees from their Central Forest Reserve and some responded negatively towards free access to spiritual sites. Respondents' choices were influenced by gender, age, education level, length of time lived in the village, level of poverty, and whether they believed that the hydropower development had affected their wellbeing. Preferences also varied significantly between villages. Our findings provide insight into locally preferred options for biodiversity NNL offsets. They also demonstrate the use of choice experiments to inform decisions about biodiversity offsets, as part of ensuring that NNL strategies do not make local people worse off.

Australian rangelands are subject to invasion by alien plants that have the potential to have major impacts on ecosystem function and biodiversity, although there has been little quantitative documentation of these effects. Research is needed to improve our understanding of how and to what extent alien plants affect biodiversity in Australian rangelands so that this relationship can be considered when developing and implementing programmes to monitor biodiversity. It is also important to consolidate existing efforts to quantify the extent of alien plant invasions and monitor their progress, thus documenting a process that threatens biodiversity. Information on the presence and abundance of alien plant species should be considered for inclusion as a component of biodiversity monitoring programmes that are undertaken. Monitoring components of biodiversity can itself provide a basis for evaluating weed management strategies.

It involved two communities surrounding the park, namely Pete and Kitogani. Field data were collected using structured questionnaires, key informant interviews and field observations. Questionnaires were administered to 76 households, whereas key informant interviews were conducted with foresters and JCBNP officials. Data analysis was undertaken using standard statistical methods. Findings from the study show that biodiversity management in the JCBNP has improved considerably after the introduction of ecotourism. The number of endemic colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus kirkii) and other rare species has increased. However, this achievement has been attained by restricting surrounding communities from using forest resources without providing alternative sources of livelihood. Findings also show that the benefits from ecotourism do not reach individual households, but the community as whole, in form of various social services. This has caused some resentment among the local people leading to their reluctance to reduce their direct use of ecosystem services available in the JCBNP, claiming that they cannot sustain their livelihood without such services. This has become a major source of conflict between the JCBNP and surrounding communities. Increased awareness and knowledge on biodiversity conservation would be needed for the communities surrounding the park to realize the potential and long-term benefits of ecotourism, and hence the need for their increased involvement in biodiversity management.

The bio-agronomic performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment, and the pollinating fauna, were analysed. Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae). The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects in terms of covering dynamics, due to the periodic senescence of vegetation, they represent a valid instrument to improve the biodiversity and the landscape of the Mediterranean urban ecosystem.

Land Economics	05/01/2015	NA	13	We analyze what motivates Norwegian nonindustrial private forest owners to participate in a national voluntary conservation program. Our empirical study provides new insights, since the program requires participants to relinquish all rights to forestry for eternity, including future generations. To achieve an efficient conservation strategy, it is important to understand what drives motivations sufficiently strong to participate on such terms. Our econometric analyses suggest that forest owners' expectation of sustainable nontimber income enhanced by the program, positive attitude toward stricter conservation regulations, and lower share of mature forest have strong positive effects on the likelihood of participation.

5331	WOS:000175317900002	Assessing biodiversity conservation priorities: ecosystem risk and representativeness in continental Ecuador	Landscape and Urban Planning	4/15/2002	NA	84	Setting conservation priorities with a geographic vision is essential in developing countries due to limited resources for conservation and the urgency of establishing new reserves. Priorities should reflect the risk ecosystems are facing and how represented they are in current national reserve networks (NRN). Conservation planning, research, and reserve design should focus on priority ecosystems. This study identified the priority ecosystems for the conservation of continental Ecuador's biodiversity using a multi-criteria model developed in collaboration with Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment. This model ranked ecosystems based on four conditions: representativeness in the current reserve network, human pressure, habitat loss, and species-level value based on bird species data. Results show that although Ecuador's reserve network covers approximately 14% of the country, several ecosystems are poorly represented using a conservative 10% level benchmark, while others are not included at all. In general, highly diverse, humid environments are well represented while low-diversity, dry environments, are poorly represented. These low-diversity, low-representation ecosystems are also the most threatened. Conservation programs and new reserves design in continental Ecuador should concentrate on these ecosystems until the desired representativeness is attained. These results were formally presented to Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment in 2000. This study shows that an ecosystem-risk-representativeness approach can be implemented efficiently at scales that take advantage of limited resources yet are effective for policy and planning, Current technologies can be used effectively to map major ecosystems, and to assess various forms of risk and representativeness in reasonable time for a country or a large region.

The role of environmental economics and valuation of natural resources, as analytical tools that facilitate the avoidance of adverse environmental impacts, is discussed. An integrated environmental economic framework is outlined, and some practical case studies of environmental impact valuation in developing countries are summarized. The paper goes on to discuss the links between economy-wide policies (both macroeconomic and sectoral) and natural-resource degradation, and explains the important role of environmental accounting. Issues that arise in the practical implementation of efforts to conserve biodiversity in developing countries are delineated, and the status of international dialogue on agreements to protect the environment is summarized. The role of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is described, and key issues in recent GEF projects are highlighted. In-country issues arising from the implementation of policy for the protection of biodiversity are reviewed. Recent integrated conservation development projects (ICDPs) are examined, which have attempted to link protected area management with social and economic development in local communities. The final section contains the principal conclusions.

This recognition comes from both environmentalists and wildlife biologists. However, their evaluations about the conservation status of the biota are strikingly different, depicting opposite views regarding it within administrative regions of Chile, Those regions where the threats to the native biota are considered of lower importance by environmentalists are precisely the regions where wildlife biologists detect the higher numbers of threatened species and viceversa. This discrepancy demonstrates that different perceptions of the natural sourroundings may occur not only between different social groups but also within alike groups.

Winter birds were mainly migratory waterbirds like waterfowl, distributed in the islets for foraging, which was the main activity of 51% of total birds, followed by 36% roosting and 13% breeding at the lake. Evidence of breeding was recorded, such as collecting nest material, courtship behavior and food collecting for juveniles. The hierarchical cluster analysis separated the lake sites into four distinctive habitats: lake shores, open water, islets and reed beds. Seven bird species showed significant affinities with different habitat types: Laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis) favored the lake shores habitat (P< 0.04); Little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus) (P< 0.04), Pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) (P< 0.04), Common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) (P< 0.02), Pied wagtail (Motacilla alba) (P< 0.04), and Graceful prinina (Prinia gracilis) (P< 0.01) were found in islands habitat. Little egret (Egretta garzetta) dominated the reed beds habitat group (P< 0.03). The results reflected the importance of Burullus Lake as a wintering and breeding habitat for birds and suggested that more implemented conservation and management strategies should be adopted.

However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.	Gonzalez, Andrew ; Cardinale, Bradley J. ; Allington, Ginger R.

We combined the results of long-term experiments where forest mixtures and corresponding monocultures were compared on the same site to estimate the yield of mixed-species stands at a global scale, and its response to climatic factors. We found positive mixture effects on productivity using a meta-analysis of 126 case studies established at 60 sites spread across five continents. Overall, the productivity of mixed-species forests was 15% greater than the average of their component monocultures, and not statistically lower than the productivity of the best component monoculture. Productivity gains in mixed-species stands were not affected by tree age or stand species composition but significantly increased with local precipitation. The results should guide better use of tree species combinations in managed forests and suggest that increased drought severity under climate change might reduce the atmospheric carbon sequestration capacity of natural forests.

Forests provide a full suite of goods and services to subsistence farmers in the Himalayan agro-ecological system. The effects of biomass outtake on woody species richness and composition were analysed in forests under communal and government management. Interviews on forest use and perception of forest condition and ecosystem service delivery were conducted in farmer households bordering the forests. Significantly more woody species were found in the community managed forests. Species richness was negatively correlated with walking distance from the nearest village and increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Community forests were generally less degraded than government managed forests, giving support to common pool resource management. Woody vegetation represented a crucial source of fuelwood, timber, fodder, and edible, aromatic and medicinal plants. Using a multidisciplinary framework to analyse ecosystem integrity and ecosystem service delivery enabled a finer understanding of these complex agro-ecological systems, giving support to evidence-based management and conservation planning for the future.

This study aimed at unravelling the impact of different management practices on soil fungal and bacterial biodiversity in vineyards as a model for permanent crops. Species diversity was assessed using an amplicon sequencing approach in a long-term field experiment in the Rheingau wine region of Germany where integrated, organic and biodynamic management practices had been in place for 10 years. Fungal community composition under integrated management differed significantly from organic and biodynamic management, whereas fungal species richness remained unaffected. Soil under integrated management had a significantly reduced bacterial species richness compared to organic, but community composition was similar to organically and biodynamically managed soils. Highest fungal richness was obtained under cover crop between rows in topsoil, arising from cover cropping and organic carbon supply.

The Report notes the increase in biodiversity loss, declining land productivity and the increase in the poaching of wildlife, among other challenges. While these problems are real, there is a need to comprehend how their solutions intersect with other national policies or development agendas in Africa. Literature shows that trading off Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the failure to draw synergy among them undermines their universal aim of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all. This chapter adds to this literature by showing that some of the efforts toward curbing biodiversity loss ironically create conditions that work against the protection of biodiversity while also deepening existing socio-economic problems. The chapter demonstrates this irony by referring to SDG 15 and its relations to inequitable land distribution in African contexts. It argues that efforts to reduce biodiversity loss by expanding protected areas and by excising land in the battle to curb rampant poaching compound the very challenges as they lead to a situation, where land alienation and poaching are entangled in a vicious and unabating cycle.

The efficiency of agricultural subsidy programmes for preserving biodiversity and improving the environment has been questioned in recent years. Organic farming operates without pesticides, herbicides and inorganic fertilizers, and usually with a more diverse crop rotation. It has been suggested that this system enhances biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We analysed the effects of organic farming on species richness and abundance using meta-analysis of literature published before December 2002. 2. Organic farming usually increases species richness, having on average 30% higher species richness than conventional farming systems. However, the results were variable among studies, and 16% of them actually showed a negative effect of organic farming on species richness. We therefore divided the data into different organism groups and according to the spatial scale of the study. 3. Birds, insects and plants usually showed an increased species richness in organic farming systems. However, the number of studies was low in most organism groups (range 2-19) and there was significant heterogeneity between studies. The effect of organic farming was largest in studies performed at the plot scale. In studies at the farm scale, when organic and conventional farms were matched according to landscape structure, the effect was significant but highly heterogeneous. 4. On average, organisms were 50% more abundant in organic farming systems, but the results were highly variable between studies and organism groups. Birds, predatory insects, soil organisms and plants responded positively to organic farming, while non-predatory insects and pests did not. The positive effects of organic farming on abundance were prominent at the plot and field scales, but not for farms in matched landscapes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that organic farming often has positive effects on species richness and abundance, but that its effects are likely to differ between organism groups and landscapes. We suggest that positive effects of organic farming on species richness can be expected in intensively managed agricultural landscapes, but not in small-scale landscapes comprising many other biotopes as well as agricultural fields. Measures to preserve and enhance biodiversity should be more landscape- and farm-specific than is presently the case.

Collections are unique data in that they each represent a biological record at a single place and time that cannot be obtained by any other method. Collections-based experiences lead to an increased understanding of and substantive interaction with the living world. Global biological diversity and changes in that diversity are directly tracked through specimens in collections, regardless of whether changes are ancient or recent. We discuss how collections, specimens, and the data associated with them, can be critical components linking nature and scientific inquiry. Specimens are the basic tools for educating students and interested citizens through direct or virtual contact with the diversity of collections. Such interactions include instruction in a formal classroom setting, volunteering to gather and curate collections, and informal presentations at coffee shops. We emphasize how the recent surge in specimen-based digitization initiatives has resulted in unprecedented access to a wealth of biodiversity information and how this availability vastly expands the reach of natural history collections. The emergence of online databases enables scientists and the public to utilize the specimens and associated data contained in natural history collections to address global, regional, and local issues related to biodiversity in a way that was unachievable a decade ago.

However, the generality of this effect remains controversial. Here, we present the analysis of 205 biodiversity-disease relationships on 67 parasite species to test whether biodiversity-disease relationships are generally nonlinear, moderated by spatial scale, and sensitive to underrepresentation in the literature. Our analysis of the published literature reveals that biodiversity-disease relationships are generally hump-shaped (i.e., nonlinear) and biodiversity generally inhibits disease at local scales, but this effect weakens as spatial scale increases. Spatial scale is, however, related to study design and parasite type, highlighting the need for additional multiscale research. Few studies are unrepresentative of communities at low diversity, but missing data at low diversity from field studies could result in underreporting of amplification effects. Experiments appear to underrepresent high-diversity communities, which could result in underreporting of dilution effects. Despite context dependence, biodiversity loss at local scales appears to increase disease, suggesting that at local scales, biodiversity loss could negatively impact human and wildlife populations.

Developments in the parallel field of neutral genetics theory allow the size of genetic neighbourhoods in the context of isolation by distance processes to be calculated. These suggest a way to estimate the geographical size of an equivalent form of local community in ecology. It is derived from the estimated spatial autocorrelation value at zero geographical distance and this is obtained using the distribution of the relative frequencies of species in field samples separated by varying geographical distance. A data set of 62000 beetles collected for other purposes, and consisting of beetle samples collected by fogging 52 trees in Nothofagus spp. forest and 24 trees in Araucaria forest distributed in southern Chile were used to demonstrate the proposed methods. Local communities had estimated effective community sizes (J(e)) of similar to 12000 individuals in each forest type for predators and similar to 30000 for phytophages/xylophage beetle communities. These numbers can be used in available software to estimate the number of species and the distribution of specimens between species in a local community. The geographical size of a local community can be used in other ways. Firstly, because it is related to the distance moved between birth and breeding, it provides information on the geographical scale of community processes; it gives a measure of the scales over which speedy recolonization is possible and scales over which breaks in the habitat cannot be easily crossed. Secondly, replicate samples geographically separated by less than the area of a local community are not independent, but pseudoreplicate measures of the characteristics of the metacommunity."

Until now, latitudinal patterns of species diversity (SD) and genetic diversity (GD) were rarely studied simultaneously. As the freezing-tolerance hypothesis predicts a decrease of SD from low to high latitudes and the central-marginal hypothesis predicts a unimodal pattern of GD along latitude, we hypothesized that SD and GD are uncorrelated. We also tested how climatic and edaphic factors affect the correlation between the two levels of biodiversity. Methods We measured (i) SD (species richness and Simpson's diversity index) and community dissimilarity of woody plants (63 plots), (ii) GD (allelic richness and expected heterozygosity) and genetic differentiation of a dominant tree species (Euptelea pleiospermum; 678 individuals from 21 populations) using nuclear microsatellite data, and (iii) climatic (annual mean precipitation, annual mean temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, annual relative moisture, solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation) and edaphic (total C, total N, total P, available P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, B, Mo, Cu, pH) variables of 21 sites. We conducted both linear and quadratic regression analyses of diversity parameters against latitude. Relationships between SD and GD were tested using Pearson's correlation. Pearson's and Spearman's. correlation coefficients were calculated between diversity parameters and environmental variables. We used stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify the significant environmental predictors of SD and GD. Important Findings We observed no significant correlation between measures of SD and GD. SD decreases with increasing latitude, which can be partly explained by the freezing-tolerance hypothesis, whereas GD presents a unimodal pattern along the latitudinal gradient, which is consistent with the prediction of the central-marginal hypothesis. The contrasting latitudinal patterns of SD and GD indicate that the two levels of biodiversity do not co-vary in space. Based on both correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis, SD is only related to climatic variables, whereas GD is mainly related to edaphic variables. Our results show that different geographical and environmental factors affect SD and GD, driving the non-significant correlation between the two fundamental levels of biodiversity. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation was observed between genetic distance and community dissimilarity, both of which were significantly correlated with geographical distance.

Currently, the roseus group is composed by four species, while the vertebralis group consists of two. Phylogenetic relationships and species delimitation within each group are controversial. In fact, previous analyses considered that the roseus group was composed of between four to nine species. In this work, we evaluated phylogenetic relationships, diversification times, and species delimitation within the roseus group using a multi-locus dataset. For this purpose, mitochondrial (D-loop, Cyt b, and COI) and nuclear (POMC and CRYBA1) partial sequences from 164 individuals were amplified, representing all species. Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Species tree was estimated using BEAST and singular value decomposition scores for species quartets (SVDquartets). Species limits were evaluated with six coalescent approaches. Diversification times were estimated using mitochondrial and nuclear rates with LogNormal relaxed clock in BEAST. Nine well-supported monophyletic lineages were recovered in Bayesian, ML, and SVDquartets, including eight named species and a lineage composed by specimens from the Villarrica population (Boot-strap:>70, PP:>0.99). Single-locus species delimitation analyses overestimated the species number in E. migueli, E. calcaratus, and E. roseus lineages, while multi-locus analyses recovered as species the nine lineages observed in phylogenetic analyses (Ctax = 0.69). It is hypothesized that Eupsophus diversification occurred during Mid-Pleistocene (0.42-0.14 Mya), with most species having originated after the Last Southern Patagonian Glaciation (0.18 Mya). Our results revitalize the hypothesis that the E. roseus group is composed of eight species and support the Villarrica lineage as a new putative species.

The greatest number of taxa was revealed in the south, southeast, and north of the Barents Sea. The average number of taxa in the sample was at a maximum off the coast of the Svalbard Archipelago. The greatest value of the Shannon index was registered within the Murmansk coastal water mass (Barents Sea) and Svalbard Archipelago. The median values of the evenness of the abundance of fauna were 0.5-0.6. A trend to a reduction of the biodiversity parameters of zooplankton communities with increasing square of water area water area was found. An inverse correlation between the Shannon and evenness indices for the total zooplankton abundance was revealed.	Dvoretsky, V. G. ; Dvoretsky, A.

Nonetheless, sublittoral mussel beds on rocky shores have rarely been examined in a patch context to determine the processes creating and maintaining the diversity and assemblages of organisms occupying them. Whereas the species-area relationship is a well-established theory in ecology, less is known about its effect on faunal compositions in aquatic habitats. Also, the effect of patch shape and relative patch edge are poorly studied within a rocky shore mussel framework. The present study examined the effects of blue mussel patch size, patch shape, and the presence of algae and sand in mussel patches on the composition and diversity of associated macrofaunal communities in sublittoral habitats. In line with the species-area relationship, we found that the total number of taxa increased with patch size up to ca. 500 cm(2), thereafter declining. Small patches largely lacked annelid worms and showed a lower diversity of gastropod species. We also found that the diversity was further enhanced by a high biomass of blue mussels, the presence of algae and the weight of interstitial sand. The shape of the patch had no effect on species richness, but affected the species composition. We conclude that structural components of sublittoral blue mussel habitats, such as patch content and shape, greatly affect the diversity and faunal assemblage. This has important implications in conservation biology, since habitats are becoming more fragmented. Our study demonstrates that not only habitat quantity, but also quality has a large impact on species communities in marine ecosystems.

Biodiversity of farm animals and plants gives the foundation to food production that ensures the existence and future of contemporary civilizations. Rapid economic development, unfortunately, does not facilitate the preservation of biodiversity and organisms characterised by many desirable properties and features are perishing. Economic progress forces humans to abandon traditional, safe and more varied species, and to switch to monocultures and those non-native to specific habitats, but which are more productive. In this way mankind had lost forever a large part of this living deposit of the past times, and this process continues. Probably, in some cases, this results simply from the pure ignorance of local keepers concerning traditional varieties and breeds. Therefore, it is worth promoting and encouraging the efforts of both individuals and institutions in terms of a better understanding of this subject, and to seek support in the interests of present and future mankind.

While several approaches of nature protection have been applied to the terrestrial domain, aquatic biotopes frequently still lack a good ecological state as required by EU policies (WFD and MSFD). For numerous years, the underwater world has been considered as one sphere and was neglected in the development of distinctive concepts of conservation for its variety of biotopes. This paper's objective is the enhancement of ecological connectivity within the study area through the design of benthic wildlife corridors and a consequent sublittoral biotope network. A step-by-step approach is presented for the optimization of ecological potential in heavily modified coastal water bodies, using Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea) as a case study. The procedure for the development of wildlife corridors includes defining and mapping of existing biotope types, the identification of key species for each biotope type and delineating their mobility range, the reconstruction of near-natural / pre-industrial conditions and deriving the protection priorities by comparing past with current / modified conditions. By harmonizing these scientific insights with the local land use of human society, proposals for biotope restoration and improvements can be made. In Kiel Fjord, compensation measures, obligatory for human interventions, such as construction work in the marine environment in this case, have been implemented and present an opportunity to enhance the connectivity of biotopes, thus creating wildlife corridors for their inhabitants. The composition of benthic wildlife corridors, forming a sublittoral biotope network in accordance with the present anthropogenic uses, holds potential for implementation in comparably altered coastal water bodies and integration into national and international frameworks, in anticipation of its functionality.

This requires calculating the biodiversity trends in nations, whereas previously, most academic research on quantifying biodiversity concerned communities within relatively small sites. We consider design and analysis issues that CBD targets raise and explore the potential pitfalls for managers of monitoring schemes when statistical principles yield to practical constraints. We list five main criteria that well-designed monitoring programmes should meet: representative sampling locations, sufficient sample size, sufficient detections of target species, a representative sample of species, and a sound temporal sampling scheme. We examine the implications of biodiversity assessments that fail to meet these criteria and suggest ways to alleviate these implications through analytical approaches. We discuss the remarkable potential for wide-scale biodiversity monitoring offered by technological advances and by the rise of citizen science.	Buckland, S.

The protectorate contains religious and culturally significant sites, including Mount Sinai and the Monastery of Saint Katherine. Seven thousand bedouin from six tribes live in or around the protectorate. Recent development pressure, catalysed by tourism, has resulted in the natural resource base of this fragile region being overexploited. An integrated management plan is under development to conserve the area's natural and cultural heritage, and ensure community participation while expanding opportunities for sustainable tourism.

Biological Conservation	01/02/2014	10.1016/j.biocon.2013.10.009	18	Riparian forests are biodiversity hotspots and key habitats for forest conservation, yet it is not known if the protection of these habitats also provides protection for stream organisms. We used data from 50 headwater stream-forest systems in northern Finland to address this question. Our study sites formed a gradient from highly modified (by forestry) to old-growth riparian forests. We assessed whether the community structure and diversity of benthic diatoms, aquatic bryophytes, stream macroinvertebrates and red-listed species (bryophytes + invertebrates) responded to riparian habitat alteration and whether habitat classification based on site naturalness is indicative of stream conservation value. Except for diatoms and chironomid larvae, all taxonomic groups studied, as well as red-listed species, responded negatively to site modification, showing peak diversity in unmodified habitats. Also in terms of community composition, most aquatic groups responded to the gradient of site naturalness. These results suggest that woodland key habitats, although initially targeted at the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity, may prove to be valuable for the protection of stream biodiversity as well, extending their potential importance to regional biodiversity conservation.

Currently, we lack an understanding of the threat of N deposition to biodiversity at the global scale. In particular, rates of N deposition within the newly defined 34 world biodiversity hotspots, to which 50% of the world's floristic diversity is restricted, has not been quantified previously. Using output from global chemistry transport models, here we provide the first estimates of recent (mid-1990s) and future (2050) rates and distributions of N deposition within biodiversity hotspots. Our analysis shows that the average deposition rate across these areas was 50% greater than the global terrestrial average in the mid-1990s and could more than double by 2050, with 33 of 34 hotspots receiving greater N deposition in 2050 compared with 1990. By this time, 17 hotspots could have between 10% and 100% of their area receiving greater than 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), a rate exceeding critical loads set for many sensitive European ecosystems. Average deposition in four hotspots is predicted to be greater than 20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). This elevated N deposition within areas of high plant diversity and endemism may exacerbate significantly the global threat of N deposition to world floristic diversity. Overall, we highlight the need for a greater global approach to assessing the impacts of N deposition.

However, studies have barely investigated how the evolutionary dependence of species traits affects EF. Here, we developed an integrated approach combining functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) into a single space to disentangle the effects of diversity on leaf decomposition. We conducted an experiment manipulating plant leaves into litterbags containing four species (from a pool of 27) combined in four different treatments represented by low or high FD and PD; these treatments present different scenarios of trait evolution and, therefore, a treatment with high FD and low PD, for instance, mimics a community assembled by divergent trait evolution of close relatives. We found that leaf decomposition was 30% slower in pools with high FD and PD. We show species pool with higher FD and PD have non-additive effects on decomposition, which means there is a negative effect of mixtures combining species with great functional and evolutionary differences. In addition, interactive effects of PD and FD were more important to leaf decomposition than their isolated effects. Our results suggest that PD and FD have interactive effects on decomposition and represent different axes of ecosystem variation, indicating we should avoid using phylogenies as a proxy for functional diversity. We argue that future BEF experiments may alter their design by considering a multifaceted scenario investigating community effects on ecosystem functioning, and idiosyncratic effects of key traits which may determine community assembly and ecosystem processes.

However, some current European agri-environment schemes seem to be rather ineffective. A likely explanation is the lack of source populations in intensely cultivated landscapes. Remnants of natural and seminatural habitats can contribute to regional biodiversity in various ways: as essential habitats for specialised species, as stepping stones, and as temporary habitats for hibernation, larval development, or preovipository feeding. The overall percentage of arthropod species, for which seminatural habitats are an essential prerequisite for living in an agricultural landscape, was assessed with a 5 km long transect of 18 standardised trapping stations. The transect extended from an isolated area of wetland through intensely managed crop fields and grassland to an isolated semiarid meadow bordered by mixed forest. For more than 1000 arthropod species the spatial and temporal distribution of a one year's catch along the transect was interpreted with regard to their affinity to seminatural habitats. Experts were asked to judge questionable cases of apparent ubiquist species. All in all, more than 63% of all animal species (except for soil and water fauna) living in the agriculturally managed areas of the Limpach valley seem to depend on the presence of seminatural habitats. We conclude that remnant islands of natural or seminatural habitats provide the most important source populations for agri-environment schemes in order to enhance biodiversity in an otherwise depleted agricultural landscape.

Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.

Currently, these areas are under threat due to human activities such as unsustainable and destructive fishing practices, environmental phenomena, and other significant pressures related to global environmental change. The coralligenous habitats are also endangered by practices that result in the presence of abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) at sea, a worldwide phenomenon only recently stigmatized whose impacts on marine habitats and coralligenous areas are serious. The aim of this paper is to investigate the economic value of restoration strategies promoted to safeguard and improve biodiversity in these coralligenous habitats through a contingent valuation survey administered to a sample of 4000 Italians. Households' willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity restoration and conservation ranges between sic10.30 and sic64.02 depending on the assumptions underlying the different models. The main positive and significant determinants of WTP are a previous knowledge or familiarity with coralligenous habitats and biodiversity issues, income, education, environmental attitudes, and the knowledge that indiscriminate fishing may be dangerous for biodiversity in a coralligenous habitat.

Here, we present a theoretical framework to evaluate food-web complexity in terms of biodiversity. Food network unfolding is a theoretical method to transform a complex food web into a linear food chain based on ecosystem processes. Based on this method, we can define three biodiversity indices, horizontal diversity (D-H), vertical diversity (D-V) and range diversity (D-R), which are associated with the species diversity within each trophic level, diversity of trophic levels, and diversity in resource use, respectively. These indices are related to Shannon's diversity index (H'), where H' = D-H + D-V - D-R. Application of the framework to three riverine macroinvertebrate communities revealed that D indices, calculated from biomass and stable isotope features, captured well the anthropogenic, seasonal, or other within-site changes in food-web structures that could not be captured with H' alone.

The connectivity analysis presented here explores the numbers and patterns of corridors required to connect urban green spaces as part of an overall biodiversity conservation strategy. Green spaces in this study were weighted based on size and a habitat requirement of 0.5 ha for a hypothetical indicator species. Thirteen potential networks were evaluated using Gamma, Beta, and Cost Ratio indices. The study zone contained 54 green spaces (habitat nodes) with a combined area of 636.5 ha in a total urban area of approximately 2,600 ha. Several models (Travelling Salesman, Paul Revere, and Least Cost to User) were used to evaluate possible connections. These results indicated that at least 325 linkages are necessary to connect half of the nodes. Such large numbers of linkages are only feasible by enhancing the matrix of backyard habitat, planted boulevards, and utility rights-of way found in a city. Strengthening such networks should work well to support the biota protected in urban parks and wildlife refuges and the seasonal migrants that sometimes depend on urban habitats for their survival.

7574	WOS:000086194600017	Sampling termite assemblages in tropical forests: testing a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol	Journal of Applied Ecology	01/02/2000	NA	205	1. Termites play a key role in decomposition processes in tropical ecosystems. Rapid assessment of local termite assemblages requires a standardized sampling protocol capable of producing an accurate picture of species composition. This paper evaluates the efficacy of a sampling protocol designed to assess termite species richness and functional diversity in tropical forests. 2. The protocol entails a 100 m long transect consisting of 20 sections (each 5 x 2 m). One hour of human sampling effort per section is used to search for and collect termites from dead wood, soil, termite nests and other microhabitats up to a height of 2 m above ground. The protocol was tested in three forest sites where the local termite fauna was already comprehensively documented. Two transects were run at Danum Valley (Sabah, Borneo), one at Pasoh Forest Reserve (Peninsular Malaysia) and one at Mbalmayo Forest Reserve (Cameroon). 3. At the three sites the transect samples contained 31-36% of the known local termite species pool. The taxonomic and functional group composition of the transect samples did not differ significantly from that of the known local fauna. The two transects run at Danum Valley gave very similar patterns, suggesting that the protocol produces consistent within-site results. After sampling 20 sections, pseudoturnover between the two Danum transects had declined to a relatively low level. 4. The transect method is effective because it utilizes collecting expertise within a protocol that standardizes sampling effort and area. The protocol provides a much more rapid and cost-effective method for studying termite assemblage structure than sampling regimes designed to estimate population abundances. It was demonstrated that one supervised training transect was sufficient to ensure the protocol was conducted with the required level of sampling efficiency. 5. The protocol offers a rapid tool for investigating spatial and temporal patterns of termite assemblage structure in tropical forest sites. Existing data also suggest that termites warrant further investigation as ecological indicators. Termite assemblage composition shows a strong response to habitat disturbance and may be indicative of quantitative changes in the decomposition process. The termite transect has potential as a useful addition to any suite of organisms recommended for monitoring functional processes in tropical forests.

This paper aims to (1) elucidate the historical discovery rate of endemic southern African marine fishes and (2) to estimate the number of potentially undescribed endemic marine fishes in the region using a statistical model and which factors (e.g. size/depth) contribute to unknown diversity. Thirdly, all species described globally for eight families (Blennidae, Clinidae, Gobiidae, Lutjanidae, Rajidae, Sciaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Sparidae) were analysed to elucidate unknown diversity in these groups. Location The oceans of southern Africa, including Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique, encompassing sections of the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Indian Ocean. Methods Literature surveys from a number of sources were carried out to compile lists of species descriptions from 1758 onwards. Species-accumulation curves were plotted for all endemic species, as well as for different components of size and depth. A maximum likelihood model was used to estimate the number of undescribed endemic marine fishes in southern Africa, as well as for all other categories, including global families. Results Fish discovery rates in southern Africa have varied with time. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of the total endemic fish fauna remain unknown and that size is the greatest predictor of whether a fish has been described. Smaller-sized fishes and those inhabiting shallow areas are most likely to be undersampled. It is likely that most undescribed fishes inhabit the subtropical/tropical waters of the east coast. Main conclusions At the current rate of fish description, it will take at least 50 years to describe the total endemic fish fauna. However, estimates of unknown species are probably higher because of cryptic species within currently recognized taxa. Climate change may also contribute to range expansions of marine species, further complicating the status of endemicity in southern African marine fishes.	von der Heyden, Sophie	1	711891	South Africa	biodiversity ; marine fishes ; maximum likelihood estimates of marine biodiversity ; southern africa ; species-accumulation curves	2011	Fernando Urbano	yes	Afrotropical	Eastern Atlantic ocean (Namibia/South Africa) and western Indian Ocean (South Africa/Mozambique)	NA	Saltwater	Coastal waters	Big data ; Review/Opinion	0	0	Literature surveys, species-accumulation curves, maximum likelihood model	Marine fish biodiversity ...

8701	WOS:000083830400005	Assessing land-use impacts on biodiversity using an expert systems tool	Landscape Ecology	01/01/2000	NA	44	Habitat alteration, in the form of land-use development, is a leading cause of biodiversity loss in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although statutes in the U.S. may require consideration of biodiversity in local land-use planning and regulation, local governments lack the data, resources, and expertise to routinely consider biotic impacts that result from permitted land uses. We hypothesized that decision support systems could aid solution of this problem. We developed a pilot biodiversity expert systems tool (BEST) to test that hypothesis and learn what additional scientific and technological advancements are required for broad implementation of such a system. BEST uses data from the U.S. Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (GAP) and other data in a desktop GIS environment. The system provides predictions of conflict between proposed land uses and biotic elements and is intended for use at the start of the development review process. Key challenges were the development of categorization systems that relate named land-use types to ecological impacts, and relate sensitivities of biota to ecological impact levels. Although the advent of GAP and sophisticated desktop GIS make such a system feasible for broad implementation, considerable ongoing research is required to make the results of such a system scientifically sound, informative, and reliable for the regulatory process. We define a role for local government involvement in biodiversity impact assessment, the need for a biodiversity decision support system, the development of a prototype system, and scientific needs for broad implementation of a robust and reliable system.

Thus, there is a great need to understand just what ""valuing"" biodiversity or species really means, e.g. regarding how many and which species are important in providing ecosystem services or other values. Constructing ecosystem-level indices, however, requires weighting the relative contribution of species to the different values. Using farmland birds, we illustrate how species contribute to different biodiversity values, namely utilitarian (pest seed predation potential), cultural (species occurrence in poetry), conservational (declines and rarity) and inherent (all species equal) value. Major contributions to each value are often made by a subset of the community and different species are important for different values, leading to no correlations or, in some cases, negative correlations between species' relative contributions to different values. Our results and methods using relative contributions of species to biodiversity values can aid decisions when weighing different values in policies and strategies for natural resource management. We conclude that acknowledging the importance of the range of biodiversity values that are apparent from different perspectives is critical if the full value of biodiversity to society is to be realised."

Impression and compression data suggest that the flora in the Tiaojishan Formation is dominated by Bermettitales, ferns and Nilssoniales, followed by ginkgophytes; conifers and sphenopsids are less common. Abundant permineralized rhizomes are referable to diverse taxa within fern families such as Osmundaceae and Cyatheaceae. Abundant and upright fossil stumps are common in the Tiaojishan Formation. They are welt preserved with distinct growth rings and are predominatly conifers. The floristic signature of the Tiaojishan Formation indicates that subtropical to temperate warm and humid climates prevailed during the late Middle Jurassic in the Beipiao area. Growth ring pattern analysis of the fossil conifer wood demonstrates a consistent and distinct seasonal climate during this interval. The biodiversity of the remarkable Tiaojishan flora provides essential evidence for understanding the vegetation, pataeoclimate and environmental evolution of western Liaoning during the Middle to Late Jurassic.

A test with freshwater molluscs	Hydrobiologia	03/01/2018	10.1007/s10750-017-3135-1	3	Human activity has dramatically accelerated both species extinctions and introductions, and the balance of these two processes is generally expected to reduce biodiversity and increase taxonomic homogenization. However, few tests of this hypothesis have been made. We tested whether new macroinvertebrate invaders in North American freshwaters can replace the recent loss of biodiversity, particularly focusing on molluscs. We found that both crustaceans and molluscs are overrepresented among endangered and recently extinct species, as well as among invaders. For molluscs, the number of recently extinct species (79 species) was more than twice that for exotic species (38 species). In addition, molluscan invaders are from different taxonomic families than recently extinct or endangered species. While most extinct and endangered molluscs are from streams and rivers, invaders preferentially colonize lakes and reservoirs. The impact of humans on species introductions and extinctions increases with spatial scale (from local to continental scales), resulting in the increased phylogenetic dissimilarity between introduced species and native communities. Construction of dams and alteration of the flow regimes of lotic systems will continue to lead to the extinction of native species, and promote the spread of invaders, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and taxonomic homogenization.

The potential of resources for UMP dive tourism needs to be explored as a special attraction in diving tourism, especially in the character of the environment that does not have a coral reef ecosystem that is so tight. The aim of the research is to analyze the diversity, the frequency of occurrence of species, and diversity in the marine reserved in Tulamben to bring up the potential of UMP tourism resources. The study was conducted in March-August 2018 and observations were made on 6 stations in two depths using belt transects. The results showed that the UMP species in all stations was 92 species from 60 genera and they can be divided into 7 categories of marine biota. The location of the highest diversity of genera is in Singkil with 20 genera. The most frequency of appearance of biota is in the nudibranch, fish and shrimp category. Diversity of species in each site/120m(2) falls in to the medium category. The Coral Garden location of all stations has the lowest value of various biota categories due to the high diving activities which have an impact on environmental damage and can disrupt the life of the biota at this location.

Over 12 years, 84 species of macroinvertebrate were found in the inlet, but only 34 in the lake. Halobiont and halophilic species were the same in each, but there were many fewer salt-tolerant species in the lake and no freshwater species. The latter were excluded by salinity, but habitat homogeneity due to strong wave action in the lake seems to limit many salt-tolerant species to the inlet. Species richness in large saline lakes in inland Australia is limited by salinity, poor speciation opportunities engendered by their episodic nature, and habitat homogeneity.

To that end, it established a Preparatory Committee (PrepCom), to make substantive recommendations to the General Assembly on the elements of a draft text of an ILBI. The PrepCom has identified the tension between the principle of the common heritage of mankind and high seas freedoms embodied in UNCLOS as one of the issues which must be addressed in such an international agreement. Some participants in the process have proposed a sui generis regime as a way of resolving any apparent clash of these international legal principles, particularly as it relates to marine genetic resources and their access and benefit sharing. This article argues that environmental stewardship may provide the framework for such a sui generis regime. For it to do so, however, it must be grounded in international legal principles and act as a balance between competing values, perspectives and interests in the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. If appropriately redefined in this way, environmental stewardship can deliver a governance framework which addresses some of the central issues with which the PrepCom will have to deal. These include the practical problems of access and benefit sharing of the marine genetic resources of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and reconciling the conflicting pressure for international decision-making for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity on the one hand, and the maintenance of existing regional and sectoral frameworks on the other. Environmental stewardship, redefined, can provide an intellectual framework for an ILBI under UNCLOS on marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.

This new definition raises questions more than it solves them. We demonstrate that national and international organizations, local communities, and even researchers from different disciplines (anthropology, botany or genetics) identify and evaluate biodiversity differently. The various stakeholder groups have developed an unavoidable social relation with multiple aspects of biodiversity that they relate to through their job or way of life. And therefore, they pursue various conservation purposes: the preservation of place's memory through ancestral links, cultural diversity, phenotypic variability or evolutionary potential. Which disciplinary and ethical boundaries are these actors willing to compromise, in order to preserve biodiversity in the name of development? Which indicators should we choose to fulfil which goals? The contrasting examples of taro (a socially valued object, planted on taro pondfields inherited \""from the ancestors\"", linked to an important cultural diversity and to a narrow genetic-base) and coconut (a socially devalued object, cultivated in coconut plantations at the prompting of \""the Whites\"" and genetically diverse despite few named types) demonstrate that same farmers from a village in Vanuatu (South Pacific) affirm traditional ecological knowledge though their management of taro, and still participate in a market economy by intensifying their crop of coconuts.

Residents can contribute by wildlife gardening - removing environmental weeds, cultivating indigenous flora, and improving habitat in their gardens. There is currently little guidance about how best to involve residents in wildlife gardening and align their work with public land management. We explored how a purposively chosen wildlife gardening program in Melbourne, Australia engaged and supported residents to augment local government efforts to conserve indigenous biota. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with program members to understand the program's impact on their gardening and their connections with their council and community. Unpublished Council survey data were used to position interview findings on wildlife gardening activities and the value of program features. Interviewees detailed how they modified their gardening to assist their council to conserve indigenous biota. Five program features were implicated in this change: (1) on-site garden assessment; (2) indigenous community nursery; (3) communication hubs; (4) a framework that fosters experiential learning and community linkages; and (5) endorsement of each garden's potential conservation contribution. Collaborative wildlife gardening programs can engage residents to manage their land to achieve landscape-focused conservation goals while building relationships with council and community.

One approach is to use surrogates, i.e. quantities that correlate strongly with the number of species, but are easier to obtain. The purpose of this paper is to test two polychaete surrogates, one for higher taxa and one for indicator groups, that will facilitate prediction of species richness in marine soft-bottom communities. Soft sediment is an important habitat which covers most of the ocean bottom. Data on polychaetes from the North Atlantic were used since polychaetes are often numerically dominant in the benthic assemblages, both with regard to the number of species and their abundance. In the polychaete assemblages along the Norwegian coast, richness at the genus, family and order level were significantly, linearly correlated to total species richness (r greater than or equal to 0.92). Polychaetes in the order Terebellida were found to be a good indicator of polychaete species richness and to a lesser extent also of whole benthic assemblages. The group Terebellida is potentially well suited as an indicator group, since it contains long-lived, large species that are easy to sort from the sediment and it is well defined taxonomically. Although promising as proxies for species richness in marine biodiversity studies, the use of lower taxonomic resolution and indicator groups requires further investigations in more local areas where there are conservation issues.

Farmer narratives on biodiversity values in the McLaren Vale, South Australia	Land Use Policy	04/01/2019	10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.036	6	Major challenges are emerging to integrate private lands into whole-of-landscape conservation policy, especially if definitions of biodiversity and conceptions of conservation alienate farming communities. Insufficient attention has been paid to the way that farmers perceive and value biodiversity. By undertaking 'walk-and-talk' in-depth interviews with leading farmers in the South Australian viticultural region of the McLaren Vale, seven important narratives were identified on the way that farmers conceive of and exploit biodiversity on-farm. Farmers' conceptions of biodiversity challenge traditional policy divisions between 'natural' and anthropogenic biodiversity and represent a sophisticated understanding of agricultural and regional ecology. While farmers clearly recognise and prioritise important biodiversity values, the dominant policy frameworks are not effectively defining, quantifying or supporting that biodiversity which is constantly being regenerated through farming practices. A range of opportunities for better conservation emerge from a recognition that productive farming activities and associated agricultural biodiversity form a vital part of the region's biocultural heritage. Of particular importance is the need for farmer definitions of biodiversity to be included in policy both to guide new connections between private landowners and biodiversity conservation, and to normalise goals of sustainable environmental management across rural landscapes.

We focused on the situation when an oak woodland is still partly managed as an ancient game park and partly abandoned as a nature conservation amendment. We studied this effect using a multi-taxa approach with lichens, fungi and beetles and investigated their response to the changing patterns in canopy openness, dead wood distribution and host tree conditions. The study was done in the Hradec Kralov, region of the Czech Republic. We found that the maintenance of canopy openness, as determined by management, was the primary driver influencing species composition. Canopy closure led to homogenization of the beetle and lichen communities and the loss of species. Fungi were mainly driven by the amount of dead wood, and abandonment favored their species richness. The creation of a new wilderness was only profitable for fungi, and the maintenance of canopy openness was an important driver for most of the studied taxa (i.e., biodiversity maintenance). Canopy openness and the presence of veteran trees could be used as an indicator of a management history that helps conserve biodiversity. Appropriate conditions for all taxa studied could be fulfilled using wood pasturing or game keeping in combination with dead tree retention.

In this paper, we study the lowest-dimensional Lotka-Volterra competition model that exhibits chaotic trajectories, a model with four species. We observe that interaction and growth parameters leading respectively to extinction of three species, or coexistence of two, three or four species, are for the most part arranged in large regions with clear boundaries. Small islands of parameters that lead to chaos are also found. These regions where chaos occurs are, in the three cases presented here, situated at the interface between a non-chaotic four-species region and a region where extinction occurs. This implies a high sensitivity of biodiversity with respect to parameter variations in the chaotic regions. Additionally, in regions where extinction occurs which are adjacent to chaotic regions, the computation of local Lyapunov exponents reveals that a possible cause of extinction is the overly strong fluctuations in species abundances induced by local chaos at the beginning of the interval of study. For this model, we conclude that biodiversity is a necessary condition for chaos rather than a consequence of chaos, which can be seen as a signal of a high extinction risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The correlations can be deduced from the assumption that increasing plant diversity led to increasing chemical weathering of rocks and therefore an increasing flux of carbon from the atmosphere to racks, and nutrients from the continents to the oceans. The CO2 concentration dependence of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation then indicates that the diversification of land plants led to decreasing CO2 levels, while the diversification of marine animals derived from increasing nutrient availability. Under the explicit assumption that global biodiversity grows with global biomass, the conservation of carbon shows that the long-term fluctuations of CO2 levels were dominated by complementary changes in the biological and fluid reservoirs of carbon, while the much larger geological reservoir remained relatively constant in size. As a consequence, the paleontological record of biodiversity provides an indirect estimate of the fluctuations of ancient CO2 levels.

Woody material cut from hedges is considered to provide a suitable complement to maize and oilseed rape, which are currently the dominant biomass sources. Since shrubs and trees are also important habitats for birds, however, coppicing of hedges at the landscape scale may adversely affect the diversity of the avifauna. To evaluate this risk, we estimated the response of hedge birds to three management scenarios differing in cutting intensity and hedge selection. The analysis was done using hedge data of the Lautertal municipality (n = 339 hedges; Vogelsberg area, Hesse, Germany), It focused on 25 bird species, which are all listed in the hedge programme of the German Ornithological Stations. Information on the preferences of these birds for certain hedge features such as height or width was gathered by an extensive literature review. A cluster analysis on the consolidated literature data allowed us to identify three groups of birds according to their preference for certain hedge attributes. Two groups, which included Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella L.) (i) and Blackbird (Turdus merula L.) (ii), favoured trees located in hedges, but differed in their preference for hedge shape, with (i) being attracted by long and broad hedges and (ii) by high hedges. The third group, which included the Whitethroat (Sylvia communis L), preferred small hedges with gaps and medium vegetation density. Spatially explicit suitability models based on these data allowed us to predict the status quo of hedge suitability for these species groups. Field surveys proved the accuracy of the predictions to be sufficient, since the hedge suitability predicted was significantly and positively correlated to the occurrence of 9 out of the 12 testable focal species. Our models predicted biomass extraction to almost always reduce hedge suitability for the three bird groups. Concerning the Yellowhammer and the Blackbird group, a high level of biomass extraction reduced hedge suitability by approximately 20%. We thus conclude that intensively extracting biomass can significantly reduce hedge suitability for birds, despite considerable differences in habitat requirements. Considering the variable response of the bird groups to our scenarios as well as the variation in habitat occupancy by birds, however, cutting woody material from hedges nevertheless provides an option to reduce adverse effects of bioenergy production on biodiversity at the landscape scale, as long as hedge management is based on the best knowledge available.

Despite its extensive use in science and policy making, the concept of biodiversity is not widely recognized or known to people in Switzerland. Overall, 60% of all study participants (161 grammar school pupils, 110 non-graduates, and 96 graduates in the Canton of Zurich) had never heard the term biodiversity, while the others had come across it primarily in the media. Few study participants considered their school education a relevant source of information about biodiversity. Study participants most frequently referred to the diversity of plants and animals when defining biodiversity, but also quite often believed that biodiversity had something to do with ecological concepts such as the equilibrium between all components of nature. Both young people and adults held widely inaccurate ideas of the plant species richness of communities. Particularly for Switzerland, plant species richness was strongly overestimated.

We know little about alpine plant community responses to the predicted abiotic changes, or to possible changes in the biotic environment caused by climate change. Four years of experimental warming and nutrient addition altered dominance hierarchies, community structure, and diversity of an alpine biodiversity hotspot in south Norway. The previously dominant dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala was replaced by graminoids and forbs under nutrient addition and warming with nutrients. Community diversity declined due to decreased bryophyte and lichen richness and abundances, and dwarf shrub abundances. In controls and in plots with only warming, where Dryas maintained dominance, the relationships between changes in Dryas cover and changes in community parameters were negative, suggesting that Dryas controls community processes. Under nutrient addition, bryophyte and lichen diversity decreased with decreasing Dryas cover, probably due to increased competition from graminoids and forbs. The shift in dominance hierarchies changed community structure and dynamics through increased biomass, vegetation height, and competition for light. Community diversity dropped primarily because changes in the abiotic environment modified biotic interactions, highlighting that species interaction must be considered in climate change experiments and in models predicting climate change effects.

Biodiversity indicators synthesise and communicate status and trends in biodiversity, including progress towards global targets. Despite their importance in decision making, few indicators have been tested for their performance and behaviour. Here, we tested the sensitivity, responsiveness and complementarity of three indices synthesising status and trends in collapse risk, spatial distribution and health of ecosystems (i.e., the IUCN Red List Index of Ecosystems, the Ecosystem Area index, and the Ecosystem Health Index). We used a stochastic coral reef ecosystem model to evaluate the indices ability to detect changes in biodiversity under various future scenarios. We aimed to: i) test the indices sensitivity to detecting change under low and high threat; ii) examine their responsiveness in detecting changes at the onset of and changes in threat levels; iii) assess complementarity among the indices trends and values; and iv) explore the impact on the indices sensitivity and responsiveness to sampling decisions, including the scale of ecosystem classification, ecological variables used in their calculation, and frequency of reporting. Our study revealed that the ecosystem indices are sensitive, responsive and offer complementary information on changes in ecosystems, although the Red List Index of Ecosystems sometimes behaved counter-intuitively. The indices sensitivity and responsiveness depended on the nature of the threats and could be adversely affected by decisions made in the assessment process; careful variable selection in the Red List of Ecosystems assessment process is critical to reliability detecting ecosystem change. Our results suggest that that 5-year intervals in ecosystem assessment can reveal informative trends, suggesting that current guidelines for reassessment are sufficient.

Responsible science mandates that society be engaged in a dialogue over new technology, particularly where there exist global ramifications as with gene drive. We hypothesize that public attitudes towards gene drive are not formed on scientific knowledge or demographics alone, but are heavily influenced by underlying worldviews, which encapsulate a broad and interactive system of attitudes, beliefs, and values. To test this, we conducted a national survey in New Zealand (n = 8199) and found that respondents clustered into four distinct segments with underlying worldviews, better able to explain attitudes toward gene drive than either the participants' scientific knowledge or other explanatory factors such demographics, political ideology or religiosity. We found that the use of gene drive for biodiversity conservation currently has moderate (32%) levels of support in New Zealand but that varied substantially across the four segments. Should gene drive become a technically viable approach for pest control, understanding the worldviews that shape public decision-making can guide a more empathetic engagement process and empower society to participate in informed decision-making about if and how gene drive should be used for conservation purposes.

Much attention has been focused on biodiversity hotspots(1). However, the conservation of evolutionary process is now also acknowledged as a priority in the face of global change(2). Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a biodiversity index that measures the length of evolutionary pathways that connect a given set of taxa(3,4). PD therefore identifies sets of taxa that maximize the accumulation of 'feature diversity'. Recent studies, however, concluded that taxon richness is a good surrogate for PD5-9. Here we show taxon richness to be decoupled from PD, using a biome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the flora of an undisputed biodiversity hotspot - the Cape of South Africa. We demonstrate that this decoupling has real-world importance for conservation planning. Finally, using a database of medicinal and economic plant use(10), we demonstrate that PD protection is the best strategy for preserving feature diversity in the Cape. We should be able to use PD to identify those key regions that maximize future options, both for the continuing evolution of life on Earth and for the benefit of society.

It argues that mainstreaming biodiversity through CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets' implementation into the SDGs can contribute to a more systemic and comprehensive implementation of SDG 14.5 on conservation of at least 10% of marine and coastal areas. It argues that OECMs can complement MPAs and contribute to ecologically representative and effectively managed marine protected areas systems integrated into broader governance systems such as marine spatial planning. Selected global and local sectoral conservation measures are therefore highlighted in this analysis as potential forms of OECMs. At the local level, a case study of ecologically or biologically significant marine areas managed as locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) in Mozambique is discussed. This case study explores how multiple use LMMAs, which respond to short-term fisher's needs and targeted biodiversity conservation, could contribute to the achievement of specific SDGs on food security, poverty elimination and resilient ecosystems if properly supported by long-term investments, strong institutions and integrated oceans management."

We report the link between the rapid appearance of a pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in an amphibian community at El Cope, Panama, and subsequent mass mortality and loss of amphibian biodiversity across eight families of frogs and salamanders. We describe an outbreak of chytridiomycosis in Panama and argue that this infectious disease has played an important role in amphibian population declines. The high virulence and large number of potential hosts of this emerging infectious disease threaten global amphibian diversity.

Penicillium and Aspergillus are among the most important species, because they can cause irritations, infections, allergies, spoilage of food and beverages and are able to produce dangerous mycotoxins. Detection and identification of the species in these genera is very significant, because it provides relevant information about the properties of the responsible strains. Therefore, their taxonomic was determined using a phenotypic and molecular (ITS and partial beta-tubulin sequences) methods. Investigations were conducted in the poultry house located near Wrocaw in Lower Silesia (Poland). Using morphological analyses, 215 fungal strains were identified. Among them, 56 belonged to the Penicilium and Aspergillus genera. The results obtained from sequence analysis corresponded well with the morphological identification. Classification at species level was possible in most cases using the sequence data. Most isolates belong to Penicilium genus, with the follow dominating species (P. chrysogenum, P. polonicum and P. olsonii).

In the present study utilization of CaO2 in bioremediation and MF (CaO2 +FeSO4) reaction is investigated for benzene (50 mg/L) removal in continuous flow sand-packed columns. The results indicated that MF produced OH radicals markedly increased benzene remediation at first 30 days (up to 93%). But, OH. generation rate was gradually declined when the pH was increased and finally 75% of initial benzene removed after 100d. In bioremediation column, because of supplying adequate oxygen by CaO2, the number of planktonic bacteria logarithmically increased to more than 5 x 10(6) CFU/mL (two orders of magnitude) and consequently 100% benzene removal was achieved by the end of experiment. Scanning electron microscopy analysis visualized the attached biofilm growth on sand surfaces in CaO2 injected columns indicating their key role in the remediation process. The impact of each process on the microbial biodiversity of groundwater was investigated by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the 16S rRNA gene. The alpha and beta analysis indicated that microbial diversity is decreased by CaO2 injection while benzene-degrading species such as Silanimonas, Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas spp. were dominated in re mediation column.

To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests.

Here, we use seascape genetic analysis of a diversity metric, allelic richness (AR), for 47 reef species sampled across 13 Hawaiian Islands to empirically demonstrate that large reefs high in coral cover harbour the greatest genetic diversity on average. We found that a species's life history (e.g. depth range and herbivory) mediates response of genetic diversity to seascape drivers in logical ways. Furthermore, a metric of combined multi-species AR showed strong coupling to species richness and habitat area, quality and stability that few species showed individually. We hypothesize that macro-ecological forces and species interactions, by mediating species turnover and occupancy (and thus a site's mean effective population size), influence the aggregate genetic diversity of a site, potentially allowing it to behave as an apparent emergent trait that is shaped by the dominant seascape drivers. The results highlight inherent feedbacks between ecology and genetics, raise concern that genetic resilience of entire reef communities is compromised by factors that reduce coral cover or available habitat, including thermal stress, and provide a foundation for new strategies for monitoring and preserving biodiversity of entire reef ecosystems.

Emerging infectious diseases can have serious consequences for wildlife populations, ecosystem structure and biodiversity. Predicting the spatial patterns and potential impacts of diseases in free-ranging wildlife are therefore important for planning, prioritizing and implementing research and management actions. 2. We developed spatial models of environmental suitability (ES) for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the most significant disease affecting vertebrate biodiversity on record, amphibian chytridiomycosis. We applied relatively newly developed methods for modelling ES (Maxent) to the first comprehensive, continent-wide data base (comprising > 10000 observations) on the occurrence of infection with this pathogen and employed novel methodologies to deal with common but rarely addressed sources of model uncertainty. 3. We used ES to (i) predict the minimum potential geographic distribution of infection with B. dendrobatidis in Australia and (ii) test the hypothesis that ES for B. dendrobatidis should help explain patterns of amphibian decline given its theoretical and empirical link with organism abundance (intensity of infection), a known determinant of disease severity. 4. We show that (i) infection with B. dendrobatidis has probably reached its broad geographic limits in Australia under current climatic conditions but that smaller areas of invasion potential remain, (ii) areas of high predicted ES for B. dendrobatidis accurately reflect areas where population declines due to severe chytridiomycosis have occurred and (iii) that a host-specific metric of ES for B. dendrobatidis (ES for Bd(species)) is the strongest predictor of decline in Australian amphibians at a continental scale yet discovered. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide quantitative information that helps to explain both the spatial distribution and potential effects (risk) of amphibian infection with B. dendrobatidis at the population level. Given scarce conservation resources, our results can be used immediately in Australia and our methods applied elsewhere to prioritize species, regions and actions in the struggle to limit further biodiversity loss.

Based on past and present predicted species distributions, we assessed (1) whether climatic conditions may have supported species survival in the same area over the studied period, (2) the effect of ecological niche specialization on species-specific responses, and (3) the persistence of current populations in areas that were more climatically stable over time. Location Western Ghats, Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, India. Methods We assessed species' current bioclimatic preferences based on their occurrence data using MAXENT distribution modelling. The models were projected onto past climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Last Interglacial (LIG) to assess the extent of changes in species' predicted distributions through time. Further, we tested whether species' current occurrences were located non-randomly in pixels predicted to have been suitable in the past. Finally, we characterized species-specific responses in relation to plausible biogeographical scenarios. Results We identified three distinct scenarios of species' responses to past climate changes - stability, contraction and shift - depending on their bioclimatic preferences. For high-elevation species, the cool, dry LGM was less restrictive than for medium-elevation and northern lowland species. Southernmost species requiring minimal seasonality were restricted by higher LIG seasonality, and only predicted to have been present in Sri Lanka at that time. Barring these southernmost narrow endemics, past suitable habitat, within which observed current occurrences are located, were predicted for most species. Main conclusions Palaeoclimate modelling reveals the likely local persistence of most Western Ghats endemics over the last 150 kyr, a relatively recent period in this Paleogene refugium. The large spectrum of bioclimatic preferences probably arose as a result of evolutionary events prior to the Quaternary. Our results highlight the need for further studies based on molecular phylogenetics in this relatively poorly studied biodiversity hotspot.	Bose, R. ; Munoz, F. ; Ramesh, B.

Good indicators would ideally be scalable, at least for the different scales that characterize biodiversity patterns and process. Existing indicators are mostly global in scope, and often based on secondary information, such as classifications of endangered species, rather than on primary data. We propose a complementary approach, based on the increased availability of raw data about occurrences of species, cutting-edge modeling techniques for estimating distributional areas, and land-use information based on remotely sensed data to allow estimation of rates of range loss for species affected by land-use conversion. This method can be implemented by developing countries, given increasing availability of data and the open and well-documented nature of the techniques required.	Soberon, Jorge ; Peterson, A.

Driven by rising conservation concerns, freshwater ecologists have conducted a great deal of research over the past 25 y on the status, trends, autecology, and propagation of imperiled species, threats to these species, the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, metapopulation dynamics, biodiversity hotspots, reserve design, habitat restoration, communication with stakeholders, and weaknesses of protective legislation Nevertheless, existing efforts might be insufficient to stern the ongoing and coming multitude of freshwater extinctions We briefly discuss 4 important challenges for freshwater conservation. First, climate change will imperil both freshwater species and human uses of fresh water, driving engineering responses that will further threaten the freshwater biota We need to anticipate both ecological and human responses to climate change, and to encourage rational and deliberate planning of engineering responses to climate change before disasters strike. Second, because freshwater extinctions are already well underway, freshwater conservationists Must be prepared to act now to prevent further losses, even if our knowledge is incomplete, and engage more effectively with other stakeholders Third, we need to bridge the gap between freshwater ecology and conservation biology. Fourth, we Suggest that scientific societies and scholarly journals concerned with limnology or freshwater sciences need to improve their historically poor record in publishing important papers and influencing practice in conservation ecology. Failure to meet these challenges will lead to the extinction or impoverishment of the very subjects of our research	Strayer, David L. ; Dudgeon, David	2	86550 ; 35898826	USA ; Peoples R China	endangered species ; extinction ; fresh water ; limnology ; climate change ; north american benthological society	2010	Gemma Biondo	yes	Global	NA	1986-2010	Freshwater	NA	Review/Opinion	0	0	NA	Freshwater biodiversity conservation	0	0	1	NA	1	0	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	They used only animals as examples during the text, vertebrates and invertebrates

The Pleistocene glaciations during the Quaternary appear to have resulted in an impoverished groundwater fauna in northern Europe. Re-colonisation may have occurred either through long-distance dispersal from unglaciated southern areas or from local refugia. 2. The Belgian groundwater fauna was sampled at multiple sites, and its habitats characterised, to assess whether the composition of present-day stygobiotic assemblages can be attributed to either of these mechanisms. 3. A total of 202 sampling sites were selected in four hydrogeographic units of the Meuse River catchment. Sites were equally divided among the saturated and unsaturated zones of fractured aquifers (karst) and within the hyporheic and phreatic zones of porous aquifers. Seventeen environmental parameters were determined in parallel. 4. More than 140 species were recorded, including representatives of the Amphipoda, Cladocera, Copepoda, Hydrachnidia, Isopoda, Oligochaeta, Ostracoda, Mollusca, Syncarida and Nematoda. Thirty stygobiont species were identified, of which 10 species were new to the Belgian fauna, raising the total number of stygobiotic species in Belgium to 41. 5. The frequency of occurrences of stygobiotic species was always low, with 37% of the sampled sites lacking stygobionts. A few species were exclusive to one hydrological zone, although no statistically significant differences were detected in species richness at any of the four hierarchial levels considered (Meuse catchment = region, hydrogeographic units, aquifer type and hydrological zone). 6. Overall, results suggest that the stygobiotic fauna of Belgium is species-poor and mostly comprises widely distributed species with broad ecological tolerances. This supports the view that eurytopic species re-colonised the area by long-distance dispersal from refugia in southern Europe. The virtual absence of endemic species further suggests that the scenario of an ancient fauna that survived in local refugia is of minor importance.

Little has been done to identify key conservation areas in the Amazonian freshwater ecosystems of Colombia. 2. This research constitutes the first attempt to systematically identify important conservation areas in the freshwater ecosystems of the South of the Colombian Amazonian Trapezium. This effort considered not only fine filter targets (species) as central elements of decision making, but coarse filter targets (habitats), ecosystem services and social benefits, and threats. Owing to the complexity of the study area, a multi-criteria assessment constituted a good approach to tackle the issues affecting a complex ecological, cultural, social, economic and political territory. 3. Five sites stood out and were considered important as areas for targeted management: the Tarapoto Lakes System, Yahuarcaca Lakes System, Loreto-Yacu River, and Mocagua Island (Colombia) and Caballo Cocha Lake (Peru). Biodiversity conservation initiatives as well as livelihood improvement projects are currently in motion in the area aiming to find a balance between resource use and local development.

Prescribed burn vs. wildfire impacts on plants, lizards, and mammals	Ecological Applications	12/1/2011	10.1890/10-2351.1	78	Fire is a large-scale phenomenon that affects ecosystems in many parts of the world. Wildfires can have highly destructive effects on habitats and the biota they support, and land managers frequently use prescribed burning to reduce the extent of wildfires and to benefit biodiversity. Underpinned by the predictions of the intermediate disturbance (IDH) and patch mosaic burn (PMBH) hypotheses, small-scale prescribed fires are thought to maximize biodiversity by creating heterogeneous mixes of early-, mid-, and late-successional habitats across the landscape. However, evidence supporting the positive effects of prescribed burning for biodiversity is mixed. We conducted a before-after control-impact study assessing the effect of prescribed burns and a wildfire on the alpha and beta diversity of plants, mammals, and lizards in hummock grassland in arid central Australia. Diversity was assessed for up to one year after each fire. Applying the IDH and PMBH we predicted that (1) small-scale, patchy, prescribed burns, by increasing habitat heterogeneity, would increase the alpha diversity and decrease the beta diversity of our study taxa in burned patches and (2) wildfire, by creating large, homogeneous burned patches, would reduce the alpha diversity of the study taxa in burned patches but promote beta diversity at the landscape level due to the differing assemblages expected to inhabit the burned and unburned areas. In accordance with our predictions, we found that fires of differing spatial scale and heterogeneity affected alpha and beta diversity in different ways, but also that the effects were taxon dependent. In contrast to our predictions, we found a surprisingly high level of congruence between alpha and beta diversity within taxa. Our results provide little support for the application of the intermediate disturbance and patch mosaic burn hypotheses and highlight instead the importance of stochastic events such as rainfall in influencing biodiversity over the immediate postfire period in arid environments. We suggest that prescribed fire is of little utility for the broadscale conservation of biodiversity due to taxon-dependent and unpredictable species responses, but that it may be useful in creating fire breaks that serve to protect the habitats of fire-sensitive species from the effects of broadscale wildfire.

Using count index as a measure of crop biodiversity, results show that increasing crop biodiversity contributes positively to farm level productivity. In addition, the findings suggest that the level of production risk significantly responds to the level of diversity, with the effect highly conditional on the skewness. The major contribution of the paper is that, unlike previous similar studies that tended to focus on intra-crop diversity, it incorporates the mutual interdependencies across crops within a farm by focusing on inter-crop diversity. Hence the study adds to the growing empirical literature, particularly in Africa, that tests empirical relationships between productivity, risk and crop diversity. An important policy implication for a diversity rich country such as Ethiopia is that agro-biodiversity can be used to improve agricultural productivity while promoting in situ conservation.

One of the objectives is to investigate ecological patterns of the system for any evidence of regime shifts and their effects on biodiversity and abundance of zooplankton and fish stocks. Two sampling strategies have been used: collections with Continuous Plankton Recorders beginning in 1961; and collections with bongo nets during the decade of MARMAP surveys (1977-1987), augmented by a time series of collections made during the autumn and spring groundfish surveys (1977-1993). The climate regime of the region leads to distinct and recurring seasonal pulses in zooplankton biomass and species succession in each of the four subareas of the shelf ecosystem distinguished. Evidence was detected in the analyses of inter-annual variability in species abundance and zooplankton biomass. However, no evidence of a large-scale regime shift of the magnitude described recently for other areas was detected From our analyses. Species shifts in abundance and the inter-annual and decadal variability observed in zooplankton biomass levels have allowed for sufficient residual sustainability in zooplankton biodiversity and abundance to support the recovery of depleted pelagic fish stocks.

1633	WOS:000385720400002	Setting priorities for private land conservation in fire-prone landscapes: Are fire risk reduction and biodiversity conservation competing or compatible objectives?	Ecology and Society	1/1/2016	10.5751/ES-08410-210302	11	Although wildfire plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in many ecosystems, fire management to protect human assets is often carried out by different agencies than those tasked for conserving biodiversity. In fact, fire risk reduction and biodiversity conservation are often viewed as competing objectives. Here we explored the role of management through private land conservation and asked whether we could identify private land acquisition strategies that fulfill the mutual objectives of biodiversity conservation and fire risk reduction, or whether the maximization of one objective comes at a detriment to the other. Using a fixed budget and number of homes slated for development, we simulated 20 years of housing growth under alternative conservation selection strategies, and then projected the mean risk of fires destroying structures and the area and configuration of important habitat types in San Diego County, California, USA. We found clear differences in both fire risk projections and biodiversity impacts based on the way conservation lands are prioritized for selection, but these differences were split between two distinct groupings. If no conservation lands were purchased, or if purchases were prioritized based on cost or likelihood of development, both the projected fire risk and biodiversity impacts were much higher than if conservation lands were purchased in areas with high fire hazard or high species richness. Thus, conserving land focused on either of the two objectives resulted in nearly equivalent mutual benefits for both. These benefits not only resulted from preventing development in sensitive areas, but they were also due to the different housing patterns and arrangements that occurred as development was displaced from those areas. Although biodiversity conflicts may still arise using other fire management strategies, this study shows that mutual objectives can be attained through land-use planning in this region. These results likely generalize to any place where high species richness overlaps with hazardous wildland vegetation.

Despite some oscillations in salinity, the upper and lower estuaries had year-round persistent oligohaline and polyhaline conditions, respectively. Despite high species richness (55 species), the Guaragua double dagger u River Estuary fish community contains a few dominant taxa; 11% of the richness accounts for > 60% of its density and biomass. The most abundant species (in terms of both biomass and density) was Atherinella brasiliensis. Species whose densities were most strongly associated with the upper estuary were Centropomus parallelus, Ctenogobius schufeldti, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Platanichthys platana, Trinectes paulistanus, and Eugerres brasilianus. Those whose densities were most strongly associated with the lower estuary were A. brasiliensis, Sphoeroides greeleyi, Eucinostomus argenteus, Sphoeroides testudineus, Diapterus rhombeus, and Harengula clupeola. Throughout the year, canonical correspondence analysis identified: (1) the pattern of horizontal stratification of salinity along the river as being the most important variable for explaining most of the fish fauna structure; and (2) a strong relationship between the fish fauna and the salinity gradient along the estuary. Analysis of similarity further confirmed that each estuarine zone supports a year-round persistent and relatively homogeneous fish species assemblage. Total mean density and biomass remained constant over time in each estuarine habitat, but density shifted in the most abundant species, which appears related to recruitment patterns. Such species and abundance persistence likely occurs because seasonal rainfall-induced changes in river discharge are not sufficient to significantly shift runoff and salinity and thus fish assemblage structure (species composition, density and biomass) along the estuary. Such a lack of seasonal fish fauna movement as a response to changes in river flow contrasts with other estuarine systems around the world.

Comparisons were made between 10 sites with annual rock-turning disturbance and 10 with multi-decadal (historical) disturbance. At each site, shallow subtidal rocks (N = 1289 total) were lifted, organisms recorded, and rocks replaced in their original position. Biodiversity indices were calculated to evaluate how diversity varied with location within the lough, frequency of sampling disturbance, degree of hypoxia/anoxia, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and number of rocks turned. The richness of solitary invertebrates surveyed in situ averaged 21 taxa per site with significantly more in the South Basin (near the lough's connection to the ocean) than in the North Basin. The Shannon-Wiener Index did not differ significantly with variables investigated. However, evenness was higher at annually disturbed sites than at historical ones where anemones with algal symbionts often dominated. Several sites were hypoxic to anoxic under the shallow subtidal rocks. Cup corals were most abundant in the South Basin; DO was a crucial explanatory variable of these sensitive species. Solitary ascidians were most abundant at South-Basin annual sites with DO levels being a highly significant explanatory variable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A recent study constructed a national biodiversity risk assessment index (NABRAI) in order to prioritise nations for conservation assistance. The present study aimed to upgrade the original index in order to address computational and weighting inconsistencies. The results of the upgraded index corresponded relatively well with those of the original model. We feel this study goes a step further towards strengthening the methodologies for biodiversity risk assessment. However, due to the absence of theoretical constructs for biodiversity risk assessment and the considerable disagreement between the various models of biodiversity risk, we recognise a need for a more sophisticated understanding of national biodiversity risk before these models can be used to identify global conservation priorities with any degree of confidence.

The biodiversity of the soil microbial communities and the effect of diversity on the stability of the agricultural system, is unknown. Taxonomic approaches to estimating biodiversity of soil microbial communities are limited by difficulties in defining suitable taxonomic units and the apparent non-culturability of the majority of the microbial species present in the soil. Analysis of functional diversity may be a more meaningful approach but is also limited by the need to culture organisms. Approaches which do not rely on culturing organisms such as fatty acid analysis and 16S/18S rRNA analysis have provided an insight into the extent of genetic diversity within communities and may be useful in the analysis of community structure. Scale effects, including successional processes associated with organic matter decomposition, local effects associated with abiotic soil factors, and regional effects including the effect of agricultural management practices, on the diversity of microbial communities are considered. Their impact is important in relation to the minimum biodiversity required to maintain system function.

Biodiversity offsetting is about compensating that damage, typically via habitat restoration, land management, or by establishment of new protected areas. Offsets are the fourth step of the so-called mitigation hierarchy, in which ecological damage is first avoided, minimized second, and third restored locally. Whatever residual damage remains is then offset. Offsetting has been increasingly adopted all around the world, but simultaneously serious concerns are expressed about the validity of the approach. Failure of offsetting can follow from either inappropriate definition of the size and kind of offset, or, from failure in implementation. Here we address planning of offsets, and identify fundamental operational design decisions that define the intended outcome of an offsetting project, and organize these decisions around objectives, offset actions, and the three fundamental ecological axes of ecological reality: space, time and biodiversity. We also describe how the offset ratio of a project (size of offset areas compared to impact area) can be constructed based on several partial multipliers that arise from factors such as degree of compensation required relative to no net loss, partial and delayed nature of restoration or avoided loss gains, time discounting, additionality, leakage, uncertainty, and factors associated with biodiversity measurement and offset implementation. Several of these factors are partially subjective and thus negotiable. The overall purpose of this effort is to allow systematic, well informed and transparent discussion about these critical decisions in any offset project.

Plant biodiversity and endemism in mediterranean Mexico	Biodiversity and Conservation	1/1/2018	10.1007/s10531-017-1424-7	3	Six regions of northwestern (NW) Baja California (Sierra de Juarez, Sierra de San Pedro Martir, Punta Banda, Colonet, San Quintin and Valle Tranquilo) were compared for their floristic diversity. Checklists for each region were analyzed by their total, native, and endemic floras to give measures of floristic similarity and overlap, and to identify the strongest gradients affecting species distributions. Each region was floristically distinct, with significant variation in the distribution of state endemic taxa. The six regions are readily differentiated by their geographical position in a Principal Components Analysis. The strongest gradients were (a) the W-E gradient from the coast to the mountains and (b) the latitudinal gradient from N to S. These six adjacent regions are found within a local and global biodiversity hotspot that is subject to intense conservation challenges. Conservation of many areas is essential to adequately preserve the diversity of locally endemic taxa with restricted ranges, yet the coast lacks any protected areas at the state and federal level. Private reserves such as Reserva Natural San Quintin may be critical to the conservation of regionally endemic taxa.

We believe that, although birds are unlikely to be an umbrella or indicator taxon for other biota (other vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, microorganisms), they do represent a taxon that can be monitored more easily and with less effort per datum than other biotic components. It has been shown by the great participation rate of lay observers (whom we call monitors) in several schemes (notably the Birds Australia Atlas programs) that there is a capacity to mobilize the public to undertake bird surveying. Although there are many limitations to acquiring high-quality information (scale, dynamism, mobility, irruptiveness, paucity of monitors over much of the rangelands), we think that these can be dealt with to allow the use of birds as a key component of biodiversity monitoring. We outline some of the possible options for statistically characterizing monitoring data for rangeland birds.

Anthropic habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity by negatively affecting species of all taxonomic groups. Within biodiversity hotspots, habitat has been disproportionately reduced and conservation efforts have been insufficient, making restorative action necessary in productive landscapes. We tested the effect on understorey vegetation of the presence of Lupinus elegans, a nurse-plant used to foster coniferous species, by establishing comparisons between forest remnants and a restoration experiment involving the plantation of native trees. A total of 133 vascular-plant species were found within the study area: a maximum of 63 species were recorded in the restoration experiment while an adjacent plantation contained an average of 38 species, but the closest forest remnant was found to contain 65 species. The experimental restoration site clustered with adjacent plantations when comparing sites over time and at a small scale (1.15 ha), while the forest remnant remained distinct. However, the restoration site more closely resembled the forest remnant when compared with plantations at the landscape level. The site that had the largest increase in species richness was the forest remnant adjacent to the restoration experiment where almost double the number of species was recorded, from 37 to 65 species. Our results suggest that, within a biodiversity hotspot, the increased heterogeneity in plantations with lupines used in a productive landscape allows the establishment of more wild and native plant understorey species and, more importantly, promotes biodiversity in adjacent forest remnants.

In this paper, we made the first attempt to link human population structural changes with implications for biodiveristy, using Wolong Nature Reserve(southwestern China) for the endangered giant panda as a case study. From 1982 to 1996, the labor force (20-59 years of age) in the reserve jumped by 59.76 percent, although the total population size increased by only 14.65 percent. During the same time period, the sex ratio (males:females) of small children (0-4 years of age) changed from 0.98:1 to 1.20:1,and the percentage of children receiving education beyond the elementary school level increased from 14.04 to 27.47. The increase in labor force and the number of male-biased children could have more negative impacts on the panda habitat, whereas improving school education could help more young people move out of the reserve by going to college and finding jobs elsewhere and thus reduce destruction to the panda habitat.

Intensive land use in the past has had, and forestation and grass planting at present will have inevitable impacts on plant biodiversity in the Loess Plateau. Based on the analysis of floristic features within three sampling sites with different land use practices and analysis of species richness among different land use types, we discuss impacts of land use on species richness and floristic features in the Northern Loess Plateau. The results drawn from this case study are as follows: ( 1) It appears that forestation and grass planting have had a positive influence on the local species diversity, but they have contributed little to the native vegetation in terms of conserving its floristic features. ( 2) Caragana intermedia shrubland, Pinus tabulaeformis forestland, and natural grassland have made important contributions to supporting indigenous species and maintaining local plant biodiversity. ( 3) There is a significant positive correlation between land use diversity and species richness. These results imply that practicing biodiversity conservation in situ is feasible and the suitable choice for the Loess Plateau. Concrete measures for biodiversity conservation in the area can include setting up small nature reserves and diversifying land use patterns to maintain as much habitat as possible for native vegetation. The artificial Hippophae rhamnoides shrubland should not be further promoted, considering its negative influence on biodiversity conservation.

Many wildlife tourism destinations remain below their visitor and income capacities. Management strategies are needed that increase visitor satisfaction and a destination's reputation to attract more visitors. Wildlife tourism can be directly linked to biodiversity, but might also be directly and indirectly influenced by other factors, such as landscape features or infrastructure. We investigated the relationships between visitor numbers and biodiversity, along with other factors, in a major wildlife tourism destination using structural equation modeling and additionally assessed visitors' expectations and viewing preferences. We simultaneously recorded large mammal and visitor data along 78 road transects in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and conducted interviews with visitors. We also collected data on vegetation cover, visibility, landscape features and infrastructure. We found high visitor numbers at transects with high sighting probabilities of large predators, while other factors, e.g. ungulate densities or infrastructure, were only weakly associated with visitor numbers. Consistently, interview results suggested that seeing wildlife was the main reason for visiting the park, and large predators, especially lions and leopards, ranked highest among the visitors' wildlife preferences. Our results demonstrate that wildlife tourists in KNP are primarily attracted to large predators. To meet visitor expectations and to increase visitor numbers, park management should focus on the conservation of natural savannah ecosystems with large predator and prey populations. With such an ecosystem-based management, biodiversity conservation can be successful while securing wildlife tourism and its revenues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Processes by which changes in biodiversity could affect stability on the other side of the SWI include carbon transfer during feeding, decomposition of organic matter, nutrient recycling, organism recruitment and structural stabilisation of sediments. The importance of these processes will clearly vary among habitats. Direct disturbance to communities on one side of the SWI, such as created by overfishing, habitat destruction, and species invasions, has the potential to impact communities on the other side of the SWI through the many functional links. Hypotheses are proposed to suggest further areas of research to fill the large gaps in our knowledge concerning the nature and intensity of such linkages. The linkage between benthic and pelagic diversity is likely to be tighter where there is a close energetic connection between the domains, such as polar and shallow coastal waters, and where communities are dominated by selective detritivores. The quantity of carbon reserves in the sediment and the predominant mode of larval development of sediment communities probably influence the stability of below SWI communities in the face of changes in above SWI diversity.

The endangered reptiles that use these rocks as shelter-sites have attracted considerable research, but the invertebrate fauna under the same rocks has been neglected. We surveyed four sites in the Sydney region, to record the invertebrate fauna under a total of 240 rocks and quantify habitat associations of these animals. Fauna were present under almost 90% of surveyed rocks, with high overall abundance and species richness (up to seven species per rock). Our sampling regime was inadequate to fully characterise the sandstone invertebrate fauna, and thus substantially underestimates diversity on a broader spatial scale. The taxa covered a broad phylogenetic range, with ants and spiders the most abundant, widespread and species-rich lineages. The assemblage was dominated by predators and opportunistic scavengers, possibly reflecting the characteristic low productivity of these systems. Canonical correspondence analysis identified consistent linkages between specific faunal groups and microhabitat features (mainly substrate, also degree of shading and characteristics of the overlying rock). We conclude that surface rocks on Hawkesbury sandstone outcrops shelter a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna, that microhabitat features influence faunal composition, and that our ignorance of this component of biodiversity will severely hamper any rational plan to conserve these distinctive and highly threatened ecosystems.

This is a paramount issue for the conservation of many freshwater habitats and species. In this work we studied the effects of both an increase in forest cover after depopulation and land abandonment and an increase in temperature on the runoff of a Mediterranean catchment and on the aquatic and semi-aquatic fauna species of the stream (Olzinelles valley, NE Spain). Although in our simulation no decreasing trend in runoff is detected, the monthly runoff-rainfall ratio is now 15% lower than 30 years ago, a fact that may be attributed to a drier period rather than to the small afforestation experienced by the catchment in the last decades. Other factors such as increasing temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and increasing canopy cover are discussed. The observed decrease in the water flow has caused the disappearance of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis), chub (Squalius cephalus), European eel (Anguilla anguilla), and southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus). Our results suggest that in a progressively warmer climate, and especially after land abandonment processes, management of Mediterranean mountain areas should be oriented towards an appropriate distribution of agrarian and forest land-covers in terms of water availability. Down to the stream scale, the pools that keep water throughout the year should be conserved and extended to enhance its potential to maintain aquatic and semi-aquatic species populations.

Filtering of water in the field is a logistical advantage compared to transport of water to the nearest lab, and thus, appropriate filter preservation becomes crucial for maximum DNA recovery. Here, the effect of four different filter preservation strategies, two filter types, and pre-filtration were evaluated by measuring metazoan diversity and community composition, using eDNA collected from a river and a lake ecosystem. The filters were preserved cold on ice, in ethanol, in lysis buffer and dry in silica gel. Our results show that filters preserved either dry or in lysis buffer give the most consistent community composition. In addition, mixed cellulose ester filters yield more consistent community composition than polyethersulfone filters, while the effect of pre-filtration remained ambiguous. Our study facilitates development of guidelines for aquatic community-level eDNA biomonitoring, and we advocate filtering in the field, using mixed cellulose ester filters and preserving the filters either dry or in lysis buffer.

To develop relevant conservation guidelines, we investigated how harvest plans with different spatiotemporal patterns affected the persistence of sessile species with different traits and preharvest characteristics. We confronted this problem via an individual-based simulation model. We explored several harvest plans with different levels of spatiotemporal aggregation, but equivalent total harvest area, and found that extinction probabilities for each plan varied with species traits and predisturbance characteristics. Most notably, plans with large contiguous harvest units yielded particularly high extinction probabilities for dispersal-limited habitat specialists with clustered preharvest distributions. Differences between plans were small for some types of species, but highly aggregated plans yielded the highest extinction rates for all extinction-prone groups.Synthesis and applications. Our simulations suggest that reducing the size of contiguous harvest units, even while total harvest area remains constant, may reduce extinction rates in tropical production forests (assuming that road-related threats can be effectively managed). Our findings have important implications for tropical conservation efforts and also provide general insight into the compositional effects of disturbances with different spatiotemporal characteristics.

To better understand the effects of biomes on lotic ecosystems, we evaluated whether Atlantic Forest (AF) and Neotropical Savanna (NS) biomes showed distinct patterns in (i) benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and (ii) the shredder functional feeding group. We predicted that (i) richness, density, biomass, instant secondary production, eco-exergy, and specific eco-exergy would be higher for benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in AF stream sites than in NS sites. We also predicted that (ii) length, density, biomass, instant secondary production, eco-exergy, and specific eco-exergy would be higher for shredders in AF stream sites. We found that benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and taxa richness were significantly different between stream sites in the two biomes, with the AF biome being the richest. But we found no differences in density, biomass, instant secondary production, eco-exergy, or specific eco-exergy between AF and NS stream sites. For AF shredders, the mean length, density, biomass, secondary production and eco-exergy were significantly higher than for NS stream sites. These differences were attributed to the quality of leaf litter, which was generally higher in AF than in NS stream sites. This indicates that the intrinsic characteristics of the AF and NS biomes act as structuring factors for benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, influencing the structure and functioning of tropical lotic ecosystems.	dos Santos, Gisele Moreira ; Linares, Marden Seabra ; Callisto, Marcos ; Marques, Joao Carlos	4	4200369 ; 3820661 ; 362902 ; 42024656	Brazil ; Portugal	benthic macroinvertebrates ; brazilian hotspots ; eco-exergy ; secondary production	2019	Gemma Biondo	yes	Neotropical	Brazil	2013-2014	Freshwater	Araguari and Rio das Velhas River Basins, both in Minas Gerais state, Brazil	Field sampling	0	0	Benthic macroinvertebrate sampling; Biomass estimation; Estimation of instant secondary production; Calculation of exergy indicators; Data analysis	Tropical biodiversity hotspots	1	0	0	Animals	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages
6320	WOS:000457469100009	Locality or habitat? Exploring predictors of biodiversity in Amazonia	Ecography	2/1/2019	10.1111/ecog.03833	13	Amazonia is an environmentally heterogeneous and biologically megadiverse region, and its biodiversity varies considerably over space. However, existing knowledge on Amazonian biodiversity and its environmental determinants stems almost exclusively from studies of macroscopic above-ground organisms, notably vertebrates and trees. In contrast, diversity patterns of most other organisms remain elusive, although some of them, for instance microorganisms, constitute the overwhelming majority of taxa in any given location, both in terms of diversity and abundance. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to estimate prokaryote and eukaryote diversity in environmental soil and litter samples from 39 survey plots in a longitudinal transect across Brazilian Amazonia using 16S and 18S gene sequences, respectively. We characterize richness and community composition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and test their correlation with longitude and habitat. We find that prokaryote and eukaryote OTU richness and community composition differ significantly among localities and habitats, and that prokaryotes are more strongly structured by locality and habitat type than eukaryotes. Our results 1) provide a first large-scale mapping of Amazonian soil biodiversity, suggesting that OTU richness patterns might follow substantially different patterns from those observed for macro-organisms; and 2) indicate that locality and habitat factors interact in determining OTU richness patterns and community composition. This study shows the potential of DNA metabarcoding in unveiling Amazonia's outstanding diversity, despite the lack of complete reference sequence databases for the organisms sequenced.

We investigated the importance of urban public parks in the city of Rio de Janeiro with regard to the conservation of ant species by comparing both the structure of the ground-dwelling ant community between urban parks and continuous forests and the influence of environmental factors on possible differences. Fifteen urban areas were sampled (5 isolated parks, 5 non-isolated parks and 5 forest areas). Ants were sampled at sardine bait stations and through manual/visual searching in quadrats around the baits. We identified 120 ant species (4 exotic species) distributed across 38 genera and 7 subfamilies. The four exotic species were Monomorium floricola, Paratrechina longicornis, Pheidole megacephala and Tetramorium simillimum. Both the taxonomic and functional diversity of ground-dwelling ants were higher in continuous forests, followed by non-isolated and then isolated urban parks. Environmental factors were found to be key drivers influencing the differences in ant community structure among continuous forests and urban parks. Soil compaction and canopy cover predicted the diversity patterns of the taxonomic and functional compositions of the ant communities. The ant species in the study areas exhibited a non-random pattern of distribution and a spatial association of species segregation. There was high spatial turnover of ant species in the study areas, indicating that conservation efforts are required in all studied urban areas, not just those areas considered to be species rich. Therefore, we need to conserve more species in more areas, not necessarily those high in richness.	Santos, Marcus Nascimento ; Delabie, Jacques H.

We evaluated resource availability on meadows of low intensity (low/unfertilised, mown once or twice per year) and meadows of high-intensity land use (high fertilisation, mown twice or thrice) before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation, species richness and composition of flower visitors. We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low intensity and one meadow of high-intensity land use. Each survey yielded a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found during 6 h in an area of 1000 m(2). In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species. Species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43% in plants and 42% in flower visitors. Complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles and butterflies, and bees had the highest degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows of low-intensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant, bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plant flower visitor interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land use. However, later in the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant species richness, being higher on meadows of low-intensity land use. We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter plant flower visitor interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors.

6977	WOS:000313504900001	Assessing biodiversity of a freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate community through non-destructive environmental barcoding of DNA from preservative ethanol	Bmc Ecology	12/23/2012	10.1186/1472-6785-12-28	116	Background: Characterizing biodiversity in a habitat or in targeted taxonomically or socioeconomically important groups remains a challenge. Standard DNA-based biodiversity identification tools such as DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are rapidly changing the landscape of biodiversity analysis by targeting various habitats and a wide array of organisms. However, effective use of these technological advances requires optimized protocols and benchmarking against traditional tools. Here we investigate the use of commonly used preservative ethanol as a non-destructive and inexpensive source of DNA for NGS biodiversity analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates. We used the preservative ethanol added to field collected organisms (live sorted bulk benthic samples) as a source of community DNA for NGS environmental barcoding. We directly compare this approach with a DNA barcode library generated using Sanger sequencing of all individuals separated from abenthic sample as well as with NGS environmental barcoding of DNA extracted from mixed/homogenized tissue specimens of the same benthic sample. We also evaluate a multiplex PCR strategy, as compared to commonly used single amplicon workflow, using three newly designed primer sets targeting a wide array of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Results: Our results indicate the effectiveness of ethanol-based DNA in providing sequence information from 87% of taxa identified individually from mixture as compared to 89% in conventional tissue extracted DNA. Missing taxa in both DNA sources were from species with the lowest abundance (e.g. 1 individual) in the benthic mixture. Interestingly, we achieved 100% detection for taxa represented with more than 1% individuals in the mixture in both sources of DNA. Our multiplex amplification regime increased the detection as compared to any single primer set indicating the usefulness of using multiple primer sets in initial amplification of target genes. Conclusions: Although NGS approaches have significantly increased the potential of using DNA information in biodiversity analysis, robust methods are needed to provide reliable data and alleviate sample-processing bottlenecks. Here we coupled non-destructive DNA access and a multiplex PCR approach in NGS environmental barcoding for effective data generation from benthic live-sorted samples collected in bulk and preserved in ethanol. Our study provides a possible solution to sampling and vouchering challenges in using benthic samples through next-generation environmental barcoding and facilitates wider utility of DNA information, especially species-specific DNA barcodes, in ecological and environmental studies and real-world applications such as biomonitoring programs.

The coastal zone of the area includes the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. The Gulf of Thailand Coast or the East Coast has 1653 km of coastline bordering the Gulf of Thailand from Trat Province in the eastern part of the country to Narathiwat Province in the South. On the Western side, the Andaman Sea Coast is 1014 km long, i.e., from Ranong Province to Satun Province. Mangrove forests are distributed along both coasts of Thailand in 24 provinces (the 23 coastal provinces plus Phatthalung Province). Since the first mangrove survey in 1961, the mangrove cover in Thailand has been reduced due to other land uses; hence, till 2014 only 54% of original mangrove cover is left. Mangrove forests in Thailand have been reported to support high biodiversity. Long-term studies on diversity revealed that there were 81 plant species (34 true mangroves and 47 mangrove associates), 272 bird species, 1570 insect species, 101 benthos, and a number of other economically important species.

To better understand the biodiversity effect in curbing the prevalence of the SNV infection in the deer mouse population, we analyze the Peixoto & Abramson (2006) \""one host, one non-host alien\"" deterministic model. In this study, we focus on the relationship of carrying capacity and interspecific competition strength of both host and non-host species in relation to the prevalence of the infection. Bifurcation analysis is carried out to examine the dynamics of this eco-epidemiological system. Our results show that the non-host species have a certain degree of influence in suppressing the SNV prevalence, given that the environmental conditions are similar and the interspecific competition strengths are relatively weak between the host and non-host species."

Most conservation efforts target biodiversity hotspots at large scales. Such approach overlooks small-sized local hotspots, which may be rich in endemic and highly threatened species. We explore the importance of mountain rock pools (gueltas) as local biodiversity hotspots in the Sahara-Sahel. Specifically, we considered how many vertebrates (total and endemics) use gueltas, what factors predict species richness, and which gueltas are of most priority for conservation. We expected to provide management recommendations, improve local biodiversity conservation, and simultaneously contribute with a framework for future enhancement of local communities' economy. The identification of local hotspots of biodiversity is important for revaluating global conservation priorities. Methodology/Principal Findings We quantified the number of vertebrate species from each taxonomic group and endemics present in 69 gueltas in Mauritania, then compared these with species present in a surrounding area and recorded in the country. We evaluated the predictors of species number's present in each guelta through a multiple regression model. We ranked gueltas by their priority for conservation taking into account the percentage of endemics and threats to each guelta. Within a mere aggregate extent of 43 ha, gueltas hold about 32% and 78% of the total taxa analysed and endemics of Mauritania, respectively. The number of species present in each guelta increased with the primary productivity and area of gueltas and occurrence of permanent water. Droughts and human activities threaten gueltas, while 64% of them are currently unprotected. Conclusion/Significance Gueltas are crucial for local biodiversity conservation and human activities. They require urgent management plans in Mauritania's mountains. They could provide refugia under climate change being important for long-term conservation of Sahara-Sahel biodiversity. Given their disproportional importance in relation to their size, they are local hotspots of biodiversity deserving global attention.

Location Canadian Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Oceans from the intertidal zone to upper bathyal depths, encompassing 13 marine ecoregions. Methods We compiled 35 benthic datasets that encompass 3,337 taxa (70% identified to species and 21% to genus) from 13,172 samples spanning 6,117 sites. Partitioning the analyses by different gear types, ecoregions or sites, we used Hill numbers to examine spatial patterns in alpha-diversity. We used resampling and extrapolation to standardized sampling effort and examined the effects of depth, latitude, chemical energy (export particulate organic carbon [POC] flux), thermal energy (bottom temperature) and seasonality of primary production on the benthic biodiversity. Results The Canadian Arctic harboured the highest benthic diversity (e.g. epifauna and common and dominant infauna species), whereas the lowest diversity was found in the Atlantic. The Puget Trough (Pacific), Beaufort Sea, Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Northern Labrador and Southern Grand Bank (Atlantic) were the \""hotspots\"" of diversity among the ecoregions. The infauna and epifauna both exhibited hump-shaped diversity-depth relationships, with peak diversity near shelf breaks; latitude (positively) predicted infaunal diversity, albeit weakly. Food supply, as inferred from primary production and depth, was more important than thermal energy in controlling diversity patterns. Limitations with respect to calculating POC flux in coastal (e.g. terrestrial runoff) and ice-covered regions or biological interactions may explain the negative POC flux-infaunal diversity relationship. Main Conclusions We show previously unreported diversity hotspots in the Canadian Arctic and in other ecoregions. Our analyses reveal potential controlling mechanisms of large-scale benthic biodiversity patterns in Canada's three oceans, which are inconsistent with the prevailing view of seafloor energy-diversity relationships. These results provide insightful information for conservation that can help to implement further MPA networks."

Current Opinion in Insect Science	4/1/2016	10.1016/j.cois.2016.01.003	16	Plants, perhaps Earth's most accomplished chemists, produce thousands of specialized metabolites having no direct role in cell division or growth. These phytochemicals vary by taxon, with many taxa producing characteristic substance classes; and within taxa, with individual variation in structural variety and production patterns. Observations of corresponding variation in herbivore metabolism, behavior, and diet breadth motivated the development of chemical ecology research. We discuss the importance of plant biodiversity in general and phytochemical diversity in particular for biodiversity and ecological interactions at higher trophic levels. We then provide an overview of the descriptive, molecular and analytical tools which allow modern biologists to investigate phytochemical diversity and its effects on higher trophic levels, from physiological mechanisms to ecological communities.

Detection of pathogenic organisms constituting a threat for drinking water recipients	Science of the Total Environment	5/1/2020	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136732	7	The objective of the article was to present the diversity of organisms inhabiting the water supply network with particular consideration of pathogenic organisms that can cause an epidemiological threat, with the application of high throughput sequencing (HTS). The study material was water sampled from 15 points in the water supply system. High species diversity of bacteria was evidenced, as well as the presence of microorganisms from genus Clostridium and family Enterobucteriaceae. No presence of bacteria Clostridium perfringens was recorded, which suggests proper performance of water treatment processes. Owing to advanced techniques of molecular biology, the article also presents species very similar to pathogenic bacteria the detection of which is not possible by means of standard water analysis (plate culture). Based on literature data and very high similarity of the genome of the bacteria to that of pathogenic bacteria, the species are considered to potentially show the same negative character towards the recipient, and cause a serious epidemiological threat. Therefore, the performed analyses show that classic methods of assessment of sanitary quality of water are not fully sufficient, and HIS analysis should be performed as an auxiliary tool to provide the complete image of the community in the existing network.

The eight landscapes were selected to represent the diversity of the mixed agricultural landscapes of South-East Europe, where a mosaic pattern of intensively managed farmlands and high nature value semi natural grasslands is still relatively prevalent. Bird communities were described using several assemblage-level (species number, total abundance, and Shannon diversity of the assemblage, based on 15 pre-selected key farmland bird species), as well as species-level (presence/absence of the 15 bird species) indicators, which were checked against a synthetic landscape quality indicator describing the degradation of the local plant communities with respect to an ideal baseline (vegetation-based natural capital index, NCI). The authors were interested if and how the assemblage- and species-level bird indicators can describe landscape quality in South-East European agricultural mosaic landscapes. It was found that assemblage-level bird indicators were poorly associated to the landscape quality measured in terms of NCI: only total abundance correlated significantly with NCI. On the other hand, species-level indicators were much more successful in predicting landscape quality. Six (Alauda arvensis, Emberiza calandra, Falco tinnunculus, Motacilla flava, Limosa limosa, Vanellus vanellus) of the 15 farmland bird species studied showed significant positive correlation with NCI, while three species (Emberiza citrinella, Galerida cristata, Sylvia communis) exhibited negative correlations. We also found that it was possible to draw conclusions about the landscape quality in an agricultural landscape based on the bird communities better, than to predict the bird assemblages from vegetation condition. The negative correlations for species that indicate good quality habitats in Western Europe, underline the context specificity of biodiversity indicators: whereas the conditions preferred by these species can be considered relatively natural in Western Europe, they correspond to relatively degraded habitats in South-East Europe. The nine farmland bird species which showed a significant connection to NCI can be seen as potential candidates for a regional Farmland Bird Index customized for agricultural landscapes in South-East Europe, in the Pannonian biogeographic region, or in Hungary.

Seventy-five farms with an average size of 37.8 ha were chosen to be included in the study, all of which are involved in the production of crops and livestock. The diversity of the agricultural land in the group of 75 farms was low and was mainly dominated by arable land. The range of crops cultivated by farmers was quite narrow and did not exceed 13 species. On average, there were seven crop species on each farm plus a total of nine species of animals, on average two species per farm, of which the most common were cattle and pigs. Animals other than cattle and pigs accounted for only 1.3% of the total.

Unlike the eastern Brazilian Amazon, it is still a largely intact ecosystem. Underlying this landscape are large reserves of oil and gas, many yet untapped. The growing global demand is leading to unprecedented exploration and development in the region. Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized information from government sources to quantify the status of oil development in the western Amazon. National governments delimit specific geographic areas or \""blocks'' that are zoned for hydrocarbon activities, which they may lease to state and multinational energy companies for exploration and production. About 180 oil and gas blocks now cover, 688,000 km(2) of the western Amazon. These blocks overlap the most species-rich part of the Amazon. We also found that many of the blocks overlap indigenous territories, both titled lands and areas utilized by peoples in voluntary isolation. In Ecuador and Peru, oil and gas blocks now cover more than two-thirds of the Amazon. In Bolivia and western Brazil, major exploration activities are set to increase rapidly. Conclusions/Significance: Without improved policies, the increasing scope and magnitude of planned extraction means that environmental and social impacts are likely to intensify. We review the most pressing oil- and gas-related conservation policy issues confronting the region. These include the need for regional Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments and the adoption of roadless extraction techniques. We also consider the conflicts where the blocks overlap indigenous peoples' territories."

9045	WOS:000418389500055	Temporal and spatial differences between taxonomic and trait biodiversity in a large marine ecosystem: Causes and consequences	Plos One	12/18/2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0189731	16	Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, yet most biodiversity studies have taken a taxonomic approach, implying that all species are equally important. However, species do not contribute equally to ecosystem processes and differ markedly in their responses to changing environments. This recognition has led to the exploration of other components of biodiversity, notably the diversity of ecologically important traits. Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and bio-masses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition. Our study shows that taxonomy and trait-based biodiversity indicators differ in time and space and that these differences are correlated to natural and anthropogenic drivers, notably temperature, depth and substrate richness. Our findings show that trait-based biodiversity indicators add information regarding community composition and ecosystem structure compared to and in conjunction with taxonomy-based indicators. These results emphasize the importance of examining and monitoring multiple indicators of biodiversity in ecological studies as well as for conservation and ecosystem-based management purposes.

The assessment of land use impacts in decision-support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) requires spatially explicit models, but existing approaches are either not spatially differentiated or modeled at very coarse scales (e.g., biomes or ecoregions). In this paper, we develop a high-resolution (900 m) assessment method for land use impacts on biodiversity based on habitat suitability models (HSM) of mammal species. This method considers potential land use effects on individual species, and impacts are weighted by the species conservation status and global rarity. We illustrate the method using a case study of crop production in East Africa, but the underlying HSMs developed by the Global Mammals Assessment are available globally. We calculate impacts of three major export crops and compare the results to two previously developed methods (focusing on local and regional impacts, respectively) to assess the relevance of the methodological innovations proposed in this paper.

In this study, our main objective was to propose a modeling approach to investigate the potential impact of wildfire on biodiversity. The method is illustrated with an application example in New Caledonia where conservation and sustainable biodiversity management represent an important challenge. Firstly, a biodiversity loss index, including the diversity and the vulnerability indexes, was calculated for every vegetation unit in New Caledonia and mapped according to its distribution over the New Caledonian mainland. Then, based on spatially explicit fire behavior simulations (using the FLAMMAP software) and fire ignition probabilities, two original fire risk assessment approaches were proposed: a one-off event model and a multi-event burn probability model. The spatial distribution of fire risk across New Caledonia was similar for both indices with very small localized spots having high risk. The patterns relating to highest risk are all located around the remaining sclerophyll forest fragments and are representing 0.012% of the mainland surface. A small part of maquis and areas adjacent to dense humid forest on ultramafic substrates should also be monitored. Vegetation interfaces between secondary and primary units displayed high risk and should represent priority zones for fire effects mitigation. Low fire ignition probability in anthropogenic-free areas decreases drastically the risk. A one-off event associated risk allowed localizing of the most likely ignition areas with potential for extensive damage. Emergency actions could aim limiting specific fire spread known to have high impact or consist of on targeting high risk areas to limit one-off fire ignitions. Spatially explicit information on burning probability is necessary for setting strategic fire and fuel management planning. Both risk indices provide clues to preserve New Caledonia hot spot of biodiversity facing wildfires.

Half of the plots were also subjected to simulated horse trampling, to examine how the interrelationship between diversity and disturbance affected the survivorship, growth and biomass of the Ranunculus transplants. Survivorship increased with increasing initial size of individuals or decreasing species richness of the plots. Vegetative growth, reproduction and aboveground biomass were strongly enhanced in response to a log-linear loss of species richness and secondarily by a decline in the number of functional groups. Disturbance had no effect on performance of transplants with one exception, ramet formation of R. acris, which was enhanced under the trampling regime. Despite differences in clonal architecture, both Ranunculus species behaved similarly. Our results demonstrate the importance of species richness in controlling invasibility of grassland communities.

Despite reports of their high extinction risk, conservation approaches are currently constrained by their lack of valid taxonomic identity. Using an integrative approach, incorporating morphology, molecular analysis and historical photographs, this fish can now be revealed to be conspecific with Tor remadevii, a species lacking a common name, that was initially, but poorly, described in 2007 from the River Pambar, a tributary of the River Cauvery in Kerala. Currently known to be endemic and restricted to the River Cauvery basin in the Western Ghats, T. remadevii is distinguished from congeners by its prominent hump originating above the pre-opercle and extending to the origin of the dorsal fin, a well-developed mandible resulting in a terminal or slightly superior mouth position, and the dorsal orientation of the eyes. While body colouration varies (silver, bronze, greenish) and is not considered a reliable diagnostic character, orange coloration of the caudal fin (sometimes extending to all fins) is considered a consistent characteristic. Having been first brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1849, and the recreational angling (game fishing) community in 1873, it has taken over 150 years to finally provide this iconic fish with a valid scientific name. This taxonomic clarity should now assist development and delivery of urgent conservation actions commensurate with their extinction risk.	Pinder, Adrian C. ; Manimekalan, Arunachalam ; Knight, J. D.

Over 4400 lysianassoids were investigated for species richness and relative abundances, covering 20 different stations and using different sampling devices, including the southernmost baited traps deployed so far (76A degrees S). High species richness was observed: 29 morphospecies of which 5 were new to science. Molecular species delimitation methods were carried out with 109 cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) sequences obtained during this study as well as sequences from specimens sampled in other Antarctic regions. These distance-based analyses (trees and the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method) indicated the presence of 42 lineages; for 4 species, several (cryptic) lineages were found. More than 96% of the lysianassoids collected with baited traps belonged to the species Orchomenella pinguides s. l. The diversity of the amphipod scavenger guild in this ice-bound ecosystem of the Weddell Sea is discussed in the light of bottom-up selective forces. In this southernmost part of the Weddell Sea, harbouring spawning and nursery grounds for silverfish and icefishes, abundant fish and mammalian food falls are likely to represent the major food for scavengers. Finally, the importance of biodiversity surveys in the context of the establishment of a marine protected area in this region (Weddell Sea MPA) is highlighted and how future studies can contribute to a better understanding the ecological role of scavengers in this system is discussed.

For managed temperate forests, conservationists and policymakers favour fine-grained uneven-aged (UEA) management over more traditional coarse-grained even-aged (EA) management, based on the assumption that within-stand habitat heterogeneity enhances biodiversity. There is, however, little empirical evidence to support this assumption. We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales. 2. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare -diversity for Hill numbers D-0 (species richness), D-1 (Shannon diversity) and D-2 (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity. 3. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher -diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles. 4. Between-stand -diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while -diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists. 5. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.

The widely accepted paradigm of increasing biodiversity towards the tropics does not seem to be valid for macroalgal floras of the Southern Hemisphere. We compiled a database summarizing the distributional ranges of macroalgae along the coast of Argentina to test whether biodiversity decreases towards lower latitudes, as in the Pacific coast of South America, and whether breaking points in the geographical distribution can be recognized in one or more areas of the Southwest Atlantic south of 36 degrees S. We found a clear trend of decreasing biodiversity with decreasing latitude. The interpretation of some biodiversity declines is confounded by changes in the intensity of the sampling effort. A 51% reduction in algal species richness between 42 and 41 degrees S coincides with the boundary between the Argentine and Magellanic Zoogeographic Provinces. This sharp breaking point is related to a thermal anomaly caused by long residence times of water masses within San Matias Gulf, suggesting an upper thermal tolerance limit for most Antarctic/sub-Antarctic seaweeds. A further reduction occurs at 38-37 degrees S. This breaking point can be explained by the disappearance of suitable hard substrata, since rocky outcrops give place to wide extensions of sandy beaches. The impoverished algal assemblage inhabiting the northern coast of Argentina is mainly related to the reduction or disappearance of the Antarctic/sub-Antarctic floristic component. This area is characterised by a predominance of widely distributed species, Chlorophytes and opportunistic filamentous or foliose algae.

An exemplar for the development of distributed information networks in Europe	Aquatic Conservation-Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems	01/08/2008	10.1002/aqc.950	2	1. Transitional waters are ecosystems of special importance for a number of reasons and require effective management. In Greece, biodiversity and environmental data that help to manage these ecosystems do exist, although they are scattered and not easily accessible. An overarching, publicly accessible system combining all kinds of information has not been available until now. 2. The ElNet system was developed to serve these requirements. The system is a functional application consisting of a comprehensive database and an online interface with an interactive map, and search capabilities for biological and environmental data on Greek transitional waters. Nine datasets have already been integrated and are available online. Data and their metadata are documented and checked for quality to allow comparisons and reduce bias in resulting analyses. 3. The data assembled cover a broad geographical and temporal range, allowing large-scale analyses of transitional waters. These in turn produce new scientific knowledge and provide a sound basis of information for scientists, environmental managers and policy-makers. 4. Examination of the data revealed an overall insufficient quality control practice during data acquisition and digitization. A good data management and archive system can significantly improve the quality of data. To encourage scientists to submit their data to a data management centre a clear data policy document regulating rights and duties could form an incentive for data sharing. 5. Results from;l Case study carried out oil the macrobenthic inventories of the lagoonal Systems included ill the system demonstrate the potential use of this simple type of information by environmental managers and scientists. 6. The system. still in its initial phase. will be improved by integrating new datasets and developing tools for data retrieval and analyses. The database will be linked to other biodiversity databases to participate in a distributed information network and disseminate the information through other global biodiversity portals.

1586	WOS:000173303600001	Biodiversity in the Phanerozoic: a reinterpretation	Paleobiology	01/09/2001	NA	244	Many features of global diversity compilations have proven robust to continued sampling and taxonomic revision. Inherent biases in the stratigraphic record may nevertheless substantially affect estimates of global taxonomic diversity. Here we focus on short-term (epoch-level) changes in apparent diversity. We use a simple estimate of the amount of marine sedimentary rock available for sampling: the number of formations in the stratigraphic Lexicon of the United States Geological Survey. We find this to be positively correlated with two independent estimates of rock availability: global outcrop area derived from the Paleogeographic Atlas Project (University of Chicago) database, and percent continental flooding. Epoch-to-epoch changes in the number of formations are positively correlated with changes in sampled Phanerozoic marine diversity at the genus level. We agree with previous workers in finding evidence of a diversity-area effect that is substantially weaker than the effect of the amount of preserved sedimentary rock. Once the mutual correlation among change in formation numbers, in diversity, and in area flooded is taken into consideration, there is relatively little residual correlation between change in diversity and in the extent of continental flooding. These results suggest that much of the observed short-term variation in marine diversity may be an artifact of variation in the amount of rock available for study. Preliminary results suggest the same possibility for terrestrial data. Like the comparison between change in number of formations and change, in sampled diversity, which addresses short-term variation in apparent diversity, the comparison between absolute values of these quantities, which relates to longer-term patterns, also shows a positive correlation. Moreover, there is no clear temporal trend in the residuals of the regression of sampled diversity on number of formations. This raises the possibility that taxonomic diversity may not have increased substantially since the early Paleozoic. Because of limitations in our data, however, this question must remain open.

REDD+ policies present prospective win-win solutions for climate change mitigation, rural development and biodiversity conservation. Notably, protecting, enhancing and restoring forests for their carbon sequestration services has the potential to additionally promote the conservation of imperiled tropical biodiversity. However, it has become increasingly apparent that efforts to design a REDD+ mechanism that optimizes emissions reductions and associated co-benefits face significant environmental and economic trade-offs. We provide a framework for conceptualizing the major related policy options, presenting the associated trade-offs as a continuum and as functions of two key factors: (1) geographic targeting, and (2) the selection of specific forest management activities. Our analysis highlights the challenges of assessing trade-offs using existing data and valuation schemes, and the difficulty of paying for and legislating biodiversity co-benefits and safeguards within a future REDD+ mechanism.

We found 125 species of galling insects on 80 host plant species. The increase of plant species richness explained 35% of the variation in galling insect richness, corroborating the plant species richness hypothesis. Most of the galling species occurred on trees, followed by shrubs, and herbs. However, the difference in mean number of galls was only statistically significant between herbs and trees, corroborating partially the plant structural complexity hypothesis. A significant relationship was observed between galling species richness and density of herbs, and shrubs, corroborating partially the resource concentration hypothesis. Galling insect richness showed a negative correlation with magnesium, potassium, and zinc on soil, corroborating the soil fertility hypothesis. The content of magnesium, potassium, iron and CTC (T) explained 72% of the variation in galling insect richness. Plant family size positively influenced galling insect richness, corroborating the plant family size hypothesis. Overall, the results corroborate the hypothesis that predicts that habitat stress is the main factor generating the patterns of galling insect richness in Brazilian savannas.

Previous studies suggested an influence of topography on these effects, a possibility tested herein. Bird species with distributions restricted to montane (26 species) and Great Plains (19 species) regions of central and western North America were modeled, and climate change effects on their distributions compared: in general, plains species were more heavily influenced by climate change, with drastic area reductions (mode 35% of distributional area lost under assumption of no dispersal) and dramatic spatial movements (0-400 km shift of range centroid under assumption of no dispersal) of appropriate habitats. These results suggest an important generality regarding climate change effects on biodiversity, and provide useful guidelines for conservation planning.

Summing up the accumulated knowledge on biodiversity of these water bodies, the authors have noted the presence of 290 species of eukaryotic organisms, including 190 unicellular ones, and nearly 200 species of bacteria and archaea, of which at least 100 species are represented by cyanobacteria. It has been concluded that the diversity of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is still understudied. This paper is not an exhaustive review of the history of research on the biodiversity of Crimean hypersaline waters; it is rather a prelude to such a historical study, as well as a call for a broadening and deepening of the scientific knowledge of the unique biodiversity in these extreme habitats.

Because resources for conservation are limited, setting conservation priorities to use those resources effectively is crucial. To do so in a way that addresses people's most pressing concerns about biodiversity loss, managers and policy makers must understand those concerns. This study investigates preferences for an array of benefits associated with biodiversity and wildlife and the relative importance to people of each. A survey was administered to a sample of the US population to explore public preferences for types of benefits often associated with biodiversity., utilitarian (commodity and recreation), ecological (certain and uncertain), aesthetic, symbolic, and humanistic. Respondents were asked to rank hypothetical species presented in choice sets of three species, each described simply in terms of one type of benefit. A rank-ordered multinomial logit model was estimated to establish a ranking of the benefits and evaluate the sensitivity of the ranking to socio-demographic variables. The means of the sample predictions indicated the relative importance of each type of benefit. Confidence intervals were constructed to evaluate the extent to which the ranks could be distinguished from one another. Ecological functions were most important to survey respondents; commodity-based benefits and human attributes were of moderate importance; and recreation, aesthetics, and symbolic references in literature and art appeared to be least important.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness-biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness-biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness-biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness-biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness-biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.

Lessons from the uptake of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation by botanic gardens	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2012	10.1007/s10531-011-0174-1	17	International agreements and policies play an increasingly prominent role in strategies to combat biodiversity loss. However, conservation policies can only have a conservation impact if implemented. Identifying factors determining the influence of a policy on institutions could improve the process of policy development and communication. We examine how and why botanic gardens have responded to the first phase of a global conservation policy (the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation GSPC) using quantitative (questionnaires completed by 255 botanic gardens in 67 countries) and qualitative (in-depth interviews with five gardens in five countries) methods. We found that while the majority of gardens were aware of the GSPC, older gardens in the global north, and younger global south gardens are most influenced by the GSPC. Gardens that are members of a global botanic garden network and gardens with larger budgets are implementing more targets. Targets implemented tend to be aligned with existing institutional aims. Gardens highlighted an absence of a mechanism to feedback successes and failures. The GSPC has recently been reviewed and new targets for the period of 2011-2020 developed. To widen the influence of the GSPC, dissemination should include guidelines on how institutions could implement the policy, with particular focus on influencing younger global north gardens and older global south gardens. There are plans to develop a toolkit to help gardens better understand and implement the GSPC. We recommend the toolkit include a system for GSPC implementers to communicate with each other and to feedback to policy formulators.	Williams, Sophie J. ; Jones, Julia P.

Badgley: Good news for endangered species act advocates, bad news for at-risk species	Ecology Law Quarterly	01/01/2003	NA	0	In Biodiversity Legal Foundation v. Badgley, the Ninth Circuit held that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cannot delay the initial finding to list a species as threatened or endangered beyond the mandatory deadline for making a final determination to list the species. The court held that under the Endangered Species Act, both decisions must be made within twelve months of receiving the listing petition. The court rejected the Service's arguments that funding constraints prevent timely final determinations. However, the decision failed to elucidate permissible reasons for delaying the initial finding for up to a year. It also failed to determine whether the agency's Listing Priority Guidance, which relegates new listing petitions to the bottom of the Service's priority list, is valid. Moreover, while the decision will clearly benefit species' advocates by reining in agency delay, it may actually harm at-risk species that lack petitioners vying for their listing.

To benefit society and the urban ecosystem, green infrastructure should be effectively managed. We investigated carabid diversity and assemblage structure as indicators of biodiversity in green infrastructures in a rapidly developing urban area to identify the habitat's values. In addition, we attempted to reveal the effect of environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure, soil, and disturbance) that strongly contribute to carabid diversity and assemblage structure. Of the collected organisms, 6,154 individuals representing 20 carabid species were identified in the green infrastructure. Those species with flight ability and that were found in dry habitats were widely distributed and dominated green infrastructures. Carabid assemblages changed significantly in response to management practices. These changes were both positive and negative, with the negative changes increasing the instability of the carabid assemblages through the destruction of their habitat. Other factors, such as the presence of original habitat, habitat age, and habitat succession, also had a considerable effect on carabid diversity. We revealed that management practices prevented habitat succession, and these interactive effects determined carabid diversity and structure in green infrastructures.

Montane Mediterranean cities have been understudied in terms of biodiversity, although they are often embedded in biodiversity hotspots. It therefore remains an open question, to which extent they may harbor species of special conservation interest and if the latter can be incorporated in urban planning. In this context, we assessed the urban flora of urban habitats in Ioannina (NW Greece), a city located in a highly valued region in terms of biological conservation. In four study areas, 16 ha each, we recorded 379 spontaneous taxa of vascular plants and assessed their abundance by a semi-quantitative approach. The representation of alien plants is low, compared to other Mediterranean cities (2.1% archaeophytes, 9.0% neophytes). Furthermore, the low archaeophyte to neophyte ratios in all habitats and the very small absolute numbers of archaeophytes indicate an urban environment submitted to a low rate of alien introduction. Endemics and taxa included in Greek and international conservation lists comprise 7.1% of the total city flora and occur both in indiscriminately inhabit all eleven habitats studied of both seminatural and anthropogenic type, forming medium to large populations in at least one study area. Ioannina displays the highest proportion of endemic taxa (4.8%) among the Mediterranean cities surveyed to date. Our findings illustrate the potential refuge function of urban habitats within Mediterranean cities, which should be strengthened in the further urban development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

7912	WOS:000290022500014	Practical application of self-organizing maps to interrelate biodiversity and functional data in NGS-based metagenomics	Isme Journal	01/05/2011	10.1038/ismej.2010.180	36	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled the application of broad-scale sequencing in microbial biodiversity and metagenome studies. Biodiversity is usually targeted by classifying 16S ribosomal RNA genes, while metagenomic approaches target metabolic genes. However, both approaches remain isolated, as long as the taxonomic and functional information cannot be interrelated. Techniques like self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been applied to cluster metagenomes into taxon-specific bins in order to link biodiversity with functions, but have not been applied to broad-scale NGS-based metagenomics yet. Here, we provide a novel implementation, demonstrate its potential and practicability, and provide a web-based service for public usage. Evaluation with published data sets mimicking varyingly complex habitats resulted into classification specificities and sensitivities of close to 100% to above 90% from phylum to genus level for assemblies exceeding 8 kb for low and medium complexity data. When applied to five real-world metagenomes of medium complexity from direct pyrosequencing of marine subsurface waters, classifications of assemblies above 2.5 kb were in good agreement with fluorescence in situ hybridizations, indicating that biodiversity was mostly retained within the metagenomes, and confirming high classification specificities. This was validated by two protein-based classifications (PBCs) methods. SOMs were able to retrieve the relevant taxa down to the genus level, while surpassing PBCs in resolution. In order to make the approach accessible to a broad audience, we implemented a feature-rich web-based SOM application named TaxSOM, which is freely available at http://www.megx.net/toolbox/taxsom. TaxSOM can classify reads or assemblies exceeding 2.5 kb with high accuracy and thus assists in linking biodiversity and functions in metagenome studies, which is a precondition to study microbial ecology in a holistic fashion.

The dataset is derived from more than 100 publications and includes over 600 species whose ranges can be used in diversity analysis. Stratigraphically well-constrained data from the Rapla and Mannamaa boreholes, northern Estonia, are analysed separately in order to provide additional information on the Middle to Late Ordovician microphytoplankton evolution on shallow shelf settings. The total species diversity and normalised diversity curves based on range-through data show a slight decrease from the Tremadocian to Floian, which may partly be attributed to limited data available. A continuous increase in diversity from the base of the Dapingian to late Darriwilian - early Katian can be observed, with highest total diversity approaching 250 species in the Keila Regional Stage. The highest appearance rates are recorded in the Dapingian and Darriwilian. Diversity progressively diminished after the early Katian with a more pronounced decrease in the upper Ordovician Porkuni Regional Stage, corresponding to the Hirnantian. A significant faunal turnover took place in the uppermost Ordovician Pirgu and Porkuni stages, with high extinction rates as well as the appearance of many acritarch taxa that are typical of the Silurian floras. The phytoplankton diversity curves match rather well with those of several other fossil groups in Baltica, notably brachiopods and ostracods. Comparison with other palynomorphs reveals both similarities and differences. The chitinozoans show the highest diversities in the upper Darriwilian, but their later decline predates that of acritarchs. A rapid diversification of scolecodonts (jawed polychaetes) can also be observed in the upper Darriwilian. However, unlike acritarchs or chitinozoans, their diversity continues to increase until the uppermost Katian. The acritarch diversity changes are analysed and discussed in the context of palaeogeographic (northwards drifting of Baltica) and palaeoclimatologic changes (rising sea levels up to the middle part of the Upper Ordovician). The increasing diversity of the phytoplankton not only roughly correlates with the Baltic and global sea-level changes, but also with the diversification of marine invertebrate groups.

As previously demonstrated, the 12th century BCE Philistine migration-to the southern Levantine littoral, involved the transportation of pigs from Europe, engendering long term genetic displacement of local Near Eastern haplotypes. Building on this, and combining biogeographical methods of Floral List comparisons with archaeological data, we have elucidated the Philistine impact on Southern Levantine floral ecosystems. We demonstrate that previously unexploited local plants were incorporated into the Philistine milieu, and new species were introduced-from Europe, the Aegean, Egypt and Mesopotamia - resulting in the earliest locally cultivated sycamore, cumin, coriander, bay tree and opium poppy. This research has highlighted the impact of past cultures on the formation of floral ecosystems and their long-term effects on contemporary local biological diversity.

The production capability of mycotoxin from fungal isolates was also examined. The mean fungal count in 21 different water and biofilm samples was determined as 234 CFU/100 mL and 4 CFU/cm(2). A total of 32 species were identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. The most common isolated fungi belonged to the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, of which the most prevalent fungi were Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium dipodomyicola. From 42% of the surveyed CTs, aflatoxigenic A. flavus isolates were identified. The detection of opportunistic pathogens and/or allergen species suggests that open recirculating CTs are a possible source of fungal infection for both the public and for occupational workers via the inhalation of aerosols and/or skin contact.

However, it is still not clear how biodiversity conservation and ES interact with different strategies in and surrounding protected areas (PAs), the cornerstone for biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results on the interplay between biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism (a cultural ES), while controlling for environmental and socioeconomic factors in and surrounding terrestrial PAs worldwide. Results indicate that nature-based tourism is more frequent in PAs that are of higher biodiversity, older, larger, more accessible from urban areas and at higher elevation. High population density surrounding PAs and national income levels are also major socioeconomic factors related to nature-based tourism. Furthermore, PAs managed mainly for biodiversity conservation have nearly 35% more visitors than those managed for mixed use. Strict management for biodiversity is also associated with increased biodiversity. These results show the importance of biodiversity in addressing nature-based tourism and suggest this interrelationship could be altered by different management strategies used by PAs.

At present, there is a lack of studies that consider public values for marine biodiversity changes taking into account the cultural diversity within Europe. We used a contingent valuation survey to explore respondents' marginal willingness to pay (WTP) and motivations to prevent 3 levels of species loss (10, 25 and 50%) as compared to current levels for fish and all marine species. The survey was undertaken in 2 sites: the Azores islands (NE Atlantic) and the Gulf of Gdansk (Baltic Sea). Results, based on 747 interviews, showed that motivations underlying WTP for marine species conservation encompassed primarily bequest values and direct use values. Respondents from different locations differed in their attitudes and values towards marine biodiversity conservation. Scope tests revealed significant differences in WTP for different levels of species loss; however the magnitudes of the scope sensitivity were constrained by a lack of awareness about the consequences of biodiversity changes and the welfare tradeoffs involved. This result highlights the need for the scientific community to better communicate knowledge about the link between biodiversity changes and human wellbeing and to embrace a fuller dialogue between policymakers and the public. A successful ecosystem based approach must accommodate the diversity of preferences and hence may need to be adapted to reflect regional diversity within Europe.

The study's data was collected by following Q methodology in combination with semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Q methodology combines elements from quantitative and qualitative research traditions, providing researchers with a systematic and rigorous means to study human subjectivities. Primary data were gathered from stakeholders who either live, work, or have performed research in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve. A combination of interpretative discourse analysis and Q factor analysis was employed to identify perceptions. The results reveal that there are two operating discourses with clear stakeholder divisions. The science discourse is characterized by its scientific management-based ecological approach. On the other hand, the livelihoods discourse is primarily concerned about the social implications brought about by Kogelberg as a biosphere reserve. The paper goes on to argue that the meaning people attach to the concept of \""marine biodiversity conservation\"" is relational as it is based on their lived experience. It further highlights the importance of performing context-specific social research of protected areas, as it is difficult for conservation projects to meet both ecological and social needs without understanding the viewpoints of engaged stakeholders and local communities."

The valuation of natural resources allows policy makers to justify resource allocation. Using the Southampton, UK, as a case study, this paper estimates the public's perceived value of green walls to urban biodiversity, in the form of their willingness to pay (WTP). Estimates were derived using a random parameter model that accounted for socio-economic and attitudinal determinants of choice, using choice experiment data. Three green infrastructure policies were tested; two green wall designs ('living wall' and 'green facade') and an 'alternative green policy'; and compared against 'no green policy'. Results indicated a WTP associated with green infrastructure that increases biodiversity. Attitudinal characteristics such as knowledge of biodiversity and aesthetic opinion were significant, providing an indication of identifiable preferences between green policies and green wall designs. A higher level of utility was associated with the living wall, followed by the green facade. In both cases, the value of the green wall policies exceeds the estimated investment cost; so our results suggest that implementation would provide net economic benefits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The long and narrow form of the Mesoamerican landmass, and its division by a central mountain range, has served as both a bridge and a barrier. Conservation efforts in Mesoamerica are unique for the emphasis they place on regional connectivity through the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and on biodiversity conservation in managed landscapes. The emphasis on conservation in agricultural systems has fostered innovations in payment for ecosystem services, and provides novel insights on the functional role that biodiversity plays in the provisioning of ecosystem services. The increasing rate of economic development in the region and the advent of new payment for ecosystem service schemes have provided new opportunities for forest regeneration and restoration. However, the small scale of private landholdings and the diversity of land uses featured in the region, while contributing to biodiversity conservation due to their structural and floristic complexity, present challenges for biodiversity monitoring and management.

One major source for bioenergy is woody biomass from forests, including logging residues, stumps, and whole trees from young dense stands. However, at increased extraction rates of woody biomass, the forest ecosystem, its biodiversity, and its ability to contribute to fundamental ecosystem services will be affected. We used simulation and optimization techniques to assess the impact of different management strategies on the supply of bioenergy and the trade-offs between wood fuel harvesting, biodiversity, and three other ecosystem services-reindeer husbandry, carbon storage, and recreation. The projections covered 100 years and a forest area of 3 million ha in northern Sweden. We found that the development of novel and cost-effective management systems for biomass outtake from young dense stands may provide options for a significant supply of bioenergy to the emerging bioeconomy, while at the same time securing biodiversity and important ecosystem values in future stand developments. In addition, there is potential to increase the extraction of harvest residues and stumps while simultaneously improving conditions for biodiversity and the amount of carbon stored in forest ecosystems compared to current levels. However, the projected continuing trend of increased forest density (in terms of basal area) has a negative impact on the potential for reindeer husbandry and recreation, which calls for researching new management strategies on landscape levels.

Such methods, if successful, could have important applications to multi-scale biodiversity estimation and monitoring. Here we test 19 techniques using a high quality plant data set: the GB Countryside Survey 1999, detailed surveys of a stratified random sample of British landscapes. In addition to the full data set, a set of geographical and statistical subsets was created, allowing each method to be tested on multiple data sets with different characteristics. The predictions of the models were tested against the \""true\"" species-area relationship for British plants, derived from contemporaneously surveyed national atlas data. This represents a far more ambitious test than is usually employed, requiring 5-10 orders of magnitude in upscaling. The methods differed greatly in their performance; while there are 2,326 focal plant taxa recorded in the focal region, up-scaled species richness estimates ranged from 62 to 11,593. Several models provided reasonably reliable results across the 16 test data sets: the Shen and He and the Ulrich and Ollik models provided the most robust estimates of total species richness, with the former generally providing estimates within 10% of the true value. The methods tested proved less accurate at estimating the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR) as a whole; the best single method was Hui's Occupancy Rank Curve approach, which erred on average by <20%. A hybrid method combining a total species richness estimate (from the Shen and He model) with a downscaling approach (the Sizling model) proved more accurate in predicting the SAR (mean relative error 15.5%) than any of the pure upscaling approaches tested. There remains substantial room for improvement in upscaling methods, but our results suggest that several existing methods have a high potential for practical application to estimating species richness at coarse spatial scales. The methods should greatly facilitate biodiversity estimation in poorly studied taxa and regions, and the monitoring of biodiversity change at multiple spatial scales."

Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) are sites of international significance for birds identified by BirdLife International. Here, we perform EU-wide terrestrial spatial conservation prioritizations to evaluate the coverage of IBAs by SPAs, and the coverage of bird and other vertebrate distributions by IBAs and SPAs. We then investigate the distribution of potential locations for expanding the SPA network that maximize bird species' representation, and the coverage of these locations by IBAs. On average, SPAs cover 23% of the EU-wide distribution of each bird species and 25% of the distributions of amphibians, reptiles and mammals together, while IBAs provide marginally greater coverage. Overall, 76% of terrestrial IBAs in the EU are completely or partially covered by SPAs, and 66% of the IBA network area is covered by SPAs. Our results suggest that SPA designation has been significantly informed by data on the location of IBAs. While IBAs are identified using data on particular bird species of conservation concern, they also tend to have high EU-wide representation of other vertebrates. The designation of new or expanded SPAs covering a relatively small amount of currently unprotected land (particularly in the southern EU) would substantially increase SPA coverage of bird species ranges. Our analysis provides insights on the current contribution that these sites make to conserving vertebrates across the EU, and future possibilities for efficiently expanding the network.

To learn about its value for tracking trends, we examined provincial lists of terrestrial vertebrate species and subspecies at risk in British Columbia, Canada, for 1992 and 2002 to see whether changes in these lists reflected changes in the status of the taxa they represent. Examination of the case histories of individual species and subspecies showed that 65% of additions and deletions to the British Columbia Red List were the result of improvement in knowledge of species status, changes in assessment procedures, and refinements in taxonomy rather than actual changes in a species' status. Comparison to an alternate set of rank scores provided by NatureServe for taxa that appeared on both 1992 and 2002 British Columbia Red Lists revealed changes in status that were not reflected by movement from the list. Estimates of historical conservation status for species on the 1992 British Columbia Red List demonstrated ambiguity around the natural baseline with regard to tracking changes in list composition over time. We discourage the continued use of indicators based solely on conservation status as a means of tracking biodiversity. Instead we recommend advancing strategic indicators around species at risk based on long-term monitoring data, deliberate and explicitly stated baselines, and consistent methods of conservation ranking.

Using dual-stable isotope probing, we show that changes in the diversity and composition of two functional bacterial groups occur with this 'priming' effect. A single-substrate pulse suppressed native soil C loss and reduced bacterial diversity, whereas repeated substrate pulses stimulated native soil C loss and increased diversity. Increased diversity after repeated C amendments contrasts with resource competition theory, and may be explained by increased predation as evidenced by a decrease in bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies. Our results suggest that biodiversity and composition of the soil microbial community change in concert with its functioning, with consequences for native soil C stability.

We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and people's livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community, as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.

However, high uncertainty about the biodiversity outcomes of offsetting strategies has led to significant criticism in the academic and policy literature, while the ad-hoc application of offset rules within a region may lead to offsets favouring some species and communities at the expense of others. Here we explored opportunities to improve offsetting outcomes through strategic regional offset approaches, underpinned by concepts of complementarity and irreplaceability from the conservation planning literature, in comparison to more commonly used like-for-like approach. We assessed different offsetting strategies in the Hunter Valley, NSW, a rapidly developing region in Australia with an active mining industry. We quantified regional-level biodiversity losses arising from minimal to extensive mining expansion, along with species-specific impacts for 569 flora and fauna species, and prioritized areas for protection, restoration or both to offset the anticipated losses. Accounting for how well the offsets would complement existing protected areas, we compared the area needed for offsetting and the expected biodiversity outcomes among the different strategies. Our results highlight the benefits of a more systematic approach to offsetting in terms of an enhanced understanding of regional-scale impacts, more efficient identification of offset sites and improved biodiversity outcomes. Our approach encourages forward thinking about impending threats to, and opportunities for, biodiversity conservation and could serve as a template for strategic regional offset planning based on plausible scenarios of future biodiversity loss.

The Oregon Biodiversity Project engaged a diverse group of scientists, agencies, and policy experts in a 5-year process that developed a statewide biodiversity strategy. The strategy identified 42 areas, where desired ecological attributes converge with political and social circumstances likely to result in beneficial conservation actions. The project also addressed the need for incentives to be used in addition to regulatory strategies to improve the protection of biodiversity across the working landscape. A more coherent framework is needed to deliver incentives efficiently, and to monitor their effectiveness in producing desired results. Clear biodiversity goals are needed to help establish priorities. Four specific ideas are offered to help focus investments and conservation actions: (1) regional habitat conservation plans could be used to help individual landowners meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act within a broader context; (2) a state management option outlines some ideas about how states might approach biodiversity conservation programs in a holistic way; (3) a proposal for new conservation area designations has the potential to implement sustainable development goals across mixed ownerships; and (4) finally, stewardship agreements are discussed as a tool to integrate individual land management plans into a comprehensive conservation strategy.

However, a variety of indicators are already being used resulting in many, mostly incompatible, monitoring systems. In order to synthesise the different indicator approaches and to detect gaps in the development of common indicator systems, we examined 531 indicators that have been reported in 617 peer-reviewed journal articles between 1997 and 2007. Special emphasis was placed on comparing indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services across ecosystems (forests, grass- and shrublands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, soils and agro-ecosystems) and spatial scales (from patch to global scale). The application of biological indicators was found most often focused on regional and finer spatial scales with few indicators applied across ecosystem types. Abiotic indicators, such as physico-chemical parameters and measures of area and fragmentation, are most frequently used at broader (regional to continental) scales. Despite its multiple dimensions, biodiversity is usually equated with species richness only. The functional, structural and genetic components of biodiversity are poorly addressed despite their potential value across habitats and scales. Ecosystem service indicators are mostly used to estimate regulating and supporting services but generally differ between ecosystem types as they reflect ecosystem-specific services. Despite great effort to develop indicator systems over the past decade, there is still a considerable gap in the widespread use of indicators for many of the multiple components of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a need to develop common monitoring schemes within and across habitats. Filling these gaps is a prerequisite for linking biodiversity dynamics with ecosystem service delivery and to achieving the goals of global and sub-global initiatives to halt the loss of biodiversity.

Their presence in patchy habitats and low vagility may lead to long term isolation, allopatric isolation and possible cryptic speciation. Indeed, various species of Ligia have been suggested to represent instead cryptic species complexes. Past studies; however, have largely focused in Eastern Pacific and Atlantic species of Ligia, leaving in doubt whether cryptic diversity occurs in other highly biodiverse areas. The Seychelles consists of 115 islands of different ages and geological origins spread across the western Indian Ocean. They are well known for their rich biodiversity with recent reports of cryptic species in terrestrial Seychellois organisms. Despite these studies, it is unclear whether coastal invertebrates from the Seychelles harbor any cryptic diversity. In this study, we examined patterns of genetic diversity and isolation within Ligia isopods across the Seychelles archipelago by characterizing individuals from locations across both inner and outer islands of the Seychelles using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. We report the presence of highly divergent lineages of independent origin. At Aldabra Atoll, we uncovered a lineage closely related to the Ligia vitiensis cryptic species complex. Within the inner islands of Cousine, Silhouette, and Mahe we detected the presence of two moderately divergent and geographically disjunct lineages most closely related to Ligia dentipes. Our findings suggest that the Seychelles may harbor at least three novel species of Ligia in need of description and that these species may have originated independently.

6031	WOS:000169017700001	Grasshopper biodiversity and bioindicators in Australian tropical savannas: Responses to disturbance in Kakadu National Park	Austral Ecology	06/01/2001	NA	45	Grasshoppers are a dominant group of herbivorous insects throughout the world, and their high diversity, functional importance, sensitivity to disturbance and ease of sampling makes them potentially useful bioindicators for land management. In Australia, however, the dynamics of grasshopper assemblages are extremely poorly understood. Here we describe the responses of grasshopper (Acridoidea, Eumastacoidea and Tettigonioidea) assemblages in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory, Australia to disturbance associated with mining. Three questions were addressed in this study: (i) do local grasshopper assemblages show consistent responses to disturbance?; (ii) can particular species or functional groups be identified that are reliable indicators of ecological disturbance?; and (iii) to what extent do the responses of grasshopper assemblages merely reflect those of vegetation? Grasshoppers were sampled at 26 sites located in and around the Ranger uranium mine, representing three habitat types with respect to degree of disturbance: (i) 'natural' (10 sites representing a range of 'undisturbed' savanna habitats); (ii) 'disturbed' (10 sites representing a range of disturbances, but with soil intact); and (iii) 'waste rock' (six sites undergoing rehabilitation on a constructed landform). A total of 56 grasshopper species in 46 genera was recorded during the study, with site species richness ranging from five to 20. There were no significant differences between habitat types in site species diversity, but multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correspondence between grasshopper species composition and degree of habitat disturbance. Using Indicator Species Analysis, six species and one functional group were identified as significant indicators of habitat type in relation to disturbance. Grasshopper responses were correlated with that of vegetation, but grasshopper assemblages showed apparently meaningful differentiation among disturbed sites that was not evident on the basis of floristic data. Our results demonstrate that grasshopper assemblages respond to disturbances associated with human land use and that these responses do not simply reflect those of plants. Grasshoppers are therefore potentially useful bioindicators of ecological disturbance in Australia, but further work is required on the extent to which their responses reflect general ecological change.

Because humans have transformed most of the Earth's land surface, land use may play a significant role as a driver of biodiversity at a macroscale. Here we disentangle the relationships among climate, topography, land use, available energy (measured by the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]), and species richness of Japanese forest birds. Species richness was better explained at 40- and 80-km resolutions than at 5-, 10- and 20-km resolutions; it was explained by climate, topography, and land use, and the effects of land use were fully incorporated into those of climate and topography. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, natural forest area decreased, and this decrease intensified in warm lowland areas. With the loss of natural forest, species richness decreased below a certain threshold. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, species richness and NDVI increased slightly or were unchanged in cool highland areas and decreased in warm lowland areas. Species richness increased linearly with the increase in NDVI. Most effects of climate/topography on species richness in warm lowland areas were shared by those of land use, suggesting that the decrease in species richness in warm lowland areas has been caused by loss of natural forest. Therefore, it is suggested that climate and topography determined land use intensity, which in turn, drove species richness through the depletion of available energy. Increasing temperature and decreasing elevation leads to both benefits (increase in potential available energy) and costs (depletion of energy by human land-use change) for forest birds. These costs seem to override benefits in warm lowland areas.

Within conservation biology, fair coverage is particularly important given Earth's breadth of species and diversity of ecosystems. However, research on species tends to be biased towards certain taxonomic groups and geographic areas and their associated ecosystems, so it is possible that textbooks may exhibit similar biases. Considering the possibility of bias, our goal was to evaluate contemporary conservation biology textbooks to determine if they are representative of Earth's biodiversity. We found that textbooks did not accurately reflect Earth's biodiversity. Species, ecosystems, and continents were unevenly represented, few examples mentioned genetic diversity, and examples of negative human influence on the environment outweighed positive examples. However, in terms of aquatic versus terrestrial representation, textbooks presented a representative sample. Our findings suggest that modern conservation biology textbooks are biased in their coverage, which could have important consequences for educating our next generation of scientists and practitioners.

Consequently, studies concerned with the functional importance of higher trophic levels, or with the role of environmental conditions in shaping BEF relationships, are comparatively uncommon. To address this, we assessed dung beetle diversity-functioning relationships in situ, in a field experiment in the Brazilian Amazon. Dung beetles perform a number of ecological functions in habitats across the globe; in tropical forests they play a key role in the secondary dispersal of seeds. We therefore experimentally tested how the functional diversity of dung beetle communities affects seed dispersal and how BEF relationships varied with environmental context, by replicating the experiments under contrasting soil conditions. Relationships between dung beetle diversity and function were examined using diversity indices calculated using continuous morphological traits of the individuals involved in experiments, and functioning was measured as the dispersion of artificial seeds throughout the soil profile and the probability of burial. Ninety experimental plots were established across three distinct primary forest sites. We collected, identified, and measured almost 2000 beetles, and sieved around 11 Mg of soil to quantify the dispersion of 1800 seed mimics. There was a significant effect of dung beetle functional diversity on both seed dispersion and seed burial, although this depended on environmental context, with the strength or direction of responses differing across the contrasting soils. Regardless of soil type, functional richness, but not species richness, predicted seed dispersion. We therefore advocate the use of functional diversity indices over taxonomic approaches in dung beetle-focused BEF investigations. Furthermore, we highlight the difficulties in generalizing BEF relationships, even considering a single function within the same ecosystem.

Yet, these services can be negatively affected by anthropogenic stress factors. In the boreo-nemoral zone, large amounts of salts are spread each year for deicing the pavement. To address the effect of deicing salt on street lines of lime trees and how this cascades up to influence the surrounding arthropod biodiversity, we compared heavily salt-polluted, and less polluted sites in the city of Riga, Latvia. We analyzed the impairment of foliar functions and development of aphid colonies using a common garden experiment. We found marked variation in the soil physico-chemical properties in polluted vs. unpolluted sites, and the overall composition of arthropod communities, considering their abundance together with their diversity, significantly responded to site contamination. In a common garden experiment, we also showed that the exposure to increased salt levels in the soil caused functional as well as structural injuries within foliage and slowed down the development of aphid colonies. Finally, the damage inflicted by the lime tree aphids, especially in unpolluted sites, was positively correlated to the production of mucilage in the leaves, suggesting herbivore-induced mucilage production in leaves. The effects of de-icing salts thus appeared to cascade up through the trophic chain and to negatively affect not only the trees but also the associated arthropod biota. These findings point at the necessity of a wider screening of plant species and cultivars that not only better tolerate anthropogenic stress but also promote the biodiversity in cities.

Cumulative diversity is likely important to the intrinsic and functional value of ecosystems given the legacies left behind by many species. While its components-average short-term diversity (alpha) and temporal turnover (beta)-have been extensively studied, cumulative diversity itself has not. We therefore examined the environmental and community drivers of cumulative diversity with a novel hierarchical diversity partition. This partition breaks cumulative diversity into short-term, turnover, richness, and evenness components. We applied this framework to 49 tropical rock pool communities, censused over tens to hundreds of organism generations. Results uncovered two environmental regimes that differentially impacted the richness and evenness components of cumulative diversity: Occasional drying events mainly limited richness and reset communities, while less severe physicochemical variations reduced the evenness of communities. These causal pathways amount to differential controls on cumulative diversity; controls that can oppose each other to buffer diversity against change as well as create unexpected trade-offs for managers. We conclude that maintaining diversity at longer timescales requires new analytical tools and an expanded view that can account for its complexity.

This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94% of the variance in the relative abundances.

Thus, an understanding of marine biodiversity in different ecosystems is necessary for their conservation and management. Coral reefs in particular are noted for their high levels of biodiversity, and among the world's coral reefs, the subtropical Ryukyu Islands (RYS; also known as the Nansei Islands) in Japan have been shown to harbor very high levels of marine biodiversity. This study provides an overview of the state of marine biodiversity research in the RYS. First, we examined the amount of English language scientific literature in the Web of Science (WoS; 1995-2017) on six selected representative taxa spanning protists to vertebrates across six geographic sub-regions in the RYS. Our results show clear taxonomic and sub-region bias, with research on Pisces, Cnidaria, and Crustacea to be much more common than on Dinoflagellata, Echinodermata, and Mollusca. Such research was more commonly conducted in sub-regions with larger human populations (Okinawa, Yaeyama). Additional analyses with the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) records show that within sub-regions, records are concentrated in areas directly around marine research stations and institutes (if present), further showing geographical bias within sub-regions. While not surprising, the results indicate a need to address 'understudied' taxa in 'understudied sub-regions' (Tokara, Miyako, Yakutane, Amami Oshima), particularly sub-regions away from marine research stations. Second, we compared the numbers of English language scientific papers on eight ecological topics for the RYS with numbers from selected major coral reef regions of the world; the Caribbean (CAR), Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and the Red Sea (RES). As expected, the numbers for all topics in the RYS were well below numbers from all other regions, yet within this disparity, research in the RYS on 'marine protected areas' and 'herbivory' was an order of magnitude lower than numbers in other regions. Additionally, while manuscript numbers on the RYS have increased from 1995 to 2016, the rate of increase (4.0 times) was seen to be lower than those in the CAR, RES, and GBR (4.6-8.4 times). Coral reefs in the RYS feature high levels of both endemism and anthropogenic threats, and subsequently they contain a concentration of some of the world's most critically endangered marine species. To protect these threatened species and coral reef ecosystems, more data are needed to fill the research gaps identified in this study.

Successful conservation will need to embrace multiple climate adaptation approaches. but to date they have not been conveyed in an integrated way to help support immediate conservation planning and action in the face of inherent spatial uncertainty about future conditions. Instead, these multiple approaches are often conveyed as competing or contradictory alternatives, when in fact, they are complementary. We present a framework that synthesizes six promising spatially explicit adaptation approaches for conserving biodiversity. We provide guidance on implementing these adaptation approaches and include case studies that highlight how biodiversity conservation can be used in planning. We conclude with general guidance on choosing appropriate climate adaptation approaches to amend for conservation planning.

We evaluated how the relative value of information on biodiversity features and land cost varied with data structure and variability, attributes of focal species and conservation targets, and habitat suitability thresholds for contrasting bird communities in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Specifically, we used spatial distribution maps for 20 bird species, land values, and an integer linear programming model to prioritize land units (1 km(2)) that met conservation targets at the lowest estimated cost (hereafter 'efficiency'). Across scenarios, the relative value of biodiversity data increased with conservation targets, as higher thresholds for suitable habitat were applied, and when focal species occurred disproportionately on land of high assessed value. Incorporating land cost generally improved planning efficiency, but at diminishing rates as spatial variance in biodiversity features relative to land cost increased. Our results offer a precise, empirical demonstration of how spatiallyoptimized planning solutions are influenced by spatial variation in underlying feature layers. We also provide guidance to planners seeking to maximize efficiency in data acquisition and resolve potential trade-offs when setting targets and thresholds in financially-constrained, spatial planning efforts aimed at maximizing ROI in biodiversity conservation.

The sea ice isolates, along with reference strains, were analysed by numerical taxonomy and for DNA base composition in order to determine the biodiversity of sea ice bacteria. From these analyses 22 clusters of strains (phena) were obtained with most phena apparently representing novel bacterial taxa. The sea ice isolates could be categorized into three groups based on their ecophysiology: 1) slightly halophilic, psychrophilic bacteria often possessing fastidious growth requirements and which were predominantly isolated from sea ice algae biomass or from algae-rich ice samples; 2) halotolerant and psychrotolerant bacteria; and 3) non-halophilic bacteria isolated primarily from upper sections of congelation ice and other ice samples with low levels of algal biomass.

Most bacterial endophyte colony-forming units (CFU) were recovered from the carrot crown tissues (96%) compared to the periderm and metaxylem tissues of carrot storage tissues irrespective of the cultivars and field locations. Greater population densities of endophytic bacteria were recovered from the crowns of Red Core Chantenay (5.75 x 10(5) CFU/g FW in Great Village; 3.0 x 10(5) CFU/g FW in Canning) cultivar, which accounted for 78% of all of CFU recovered compared to cv. Carochoice. Independent of the cultivars, more endophytes were recovered from the carrots produced in Great Village compared to the ones grown in Canning (62 vs. 38%, respectively). Of 360 isolates examined, 28 bacterial genera were identified, of which, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Agrobacterium were the most common (31, 7 and 7%, respectively). Diversity indices showed no significant differences between the two locations. A bioassay using selected strains of bacteria was performed on 4 week-old carrot (cv. Bergen) and potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Atlantic) plantlets. In carrots, 83% of the bacterial strains tested were found to be plant growth promoting, 10% remained plant growth neutral and 7% inhibited plant growth. In contrast, in the potato bioassay 38% remained growth neutral, 33% promoted and 29% inhibited plant growth.

Organisms that grow under these conditions are usually regarded as extremophiles; however, the extreme novelty of these environments may have favor adaptive radiations of facultative extremophiles. At the Iberian Peninsula, uranium mining operations have rendered highly polluted extreme environments in multiple locations. In this study, we examined the phytoplankton diversity, community structure, and possible determining factors in separate uranium mining-impacted waters. Some of these human-induced extreme environments may be able to sustain indigenous facultative extremophile phytoplankton species, as well as alleged obligate extremophiles. Therefore, we investigated the adaptation capacity of three laboratory strains, two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and a Dictyosphaerium chlorelloides, to uranium-polluted waters. The biodiversity among the sampled waters was very low, and despite presenting unique taxonomic records, ecological patterns can be identified. The microalgae adaptation experiments indicated a gradient of ecological novelty and different phenomena of adaptation, from acclimation in some waters to non-adaptation in the harshest anthropogenic environment. Certainly, phytoplankton extremophiles might have been often overlooked, and the ability to flourish in extreme environments might be a functional feature in some neutrophilic species. Evolutionary biology and microbial biodiversity can benefit the study of recently evolved systems such as uranium-polluted waters. Moreover, anthropogenic extremophiles can be harnessed for industrial applications.

1429	WOS:000245588400007	Regional policy models for forest biodiversity analysis: Lessons from Coastal Oregon	Ecological Applications	01/01/2007	NA	7	The crisis in the early 1990s over conservation of biodiversity in the forests of the Pacific Northwest caused an upheaval in forest policies for public and private landowners. These events led to the development of the Coastal Landscape Assessment and Modeling Study (CLAMS) for the Coast Range Physiographic Province of Oregon, a province containing over two million hectares of forest with a complex mixture of public and private ownership. Over a decade, CLAMS scientists developed regional data bases and tools to enable assessments of the implications of current policies for biodiversity and have begun using these data and tools to test ideas for solving policy problems. We summarize here four main lessons from our work: (1) Regional ecosystem perspectives, while rewarding, are difficult to achieve. Helping policy makers and the public understand biodiversity policies for an entire province can assist in developing more reasoned policies. However, this result is difficult to achieve because needed scientific building blocks generally do not exist, few policy institutions address regional cross-ownership issues, people can find it difficult to take a regional view, and the appropriate region for analysis changes with the policy problem. (2) Interest in environmental policy analysis may come as much from a pursuit of power as a pursuit of understanding. Biodiversity policy analyses are often viewed as weapons in an ongoing political battle. Also, results that might destabilize existing policies generally will not be well received by those in power. (3) The relationship of regional analyses to civic processes remains challenging and unsettled. Communication between citizens and scientists takes real effort. Also, collaborative processes both inspire and constrain regional policy analysis, and scientific work often proceeds at a different pace than these processes. In the end, CLAMS's most important effect on the civic dialogue may be to change how people think about the Coast Range. (4) An important role exists for anticipatory assessments done independently by scientists. Independent review will be especially important as policy analyses shift to management of nonfederal forests. Our future efforts in CLAMS will focus on evaluating ideas for fundamental changes in forest management.	Johnson, K.

(ICES J Mar Sci 64:1735-1742, 2007) reported that areas in the Wadden Sea selected by mechanical cockle dredgers were of greater zoobenthic diversity than areas that remained undredged. The present paper attempts to explain this observation, focussing on the elevation-related zoning of the macrobenthic fauna on tidal flats. Dense beds of cockles Cerastoderma edule occur in a specific intermediate intertidal-height zone where more species are present (and reach their maximal abundance) than in either lower or higher zones. This coincidence of preferred intertidal zones in many species, including cockles, may cause the higher species richness (and higher total macrozoobenthic biomass) of the fisher-chosen dredging areas as compared to other nearby non-dredged tidal-flat areas.

Despite the global recognition of its importance, the selection of protected areas has been ad hoc and the effectiveness of such choices has rarely been assessed. We compiled the most comprehensive distributional data set of Iberian terrestrial plant and vertebrate species available to date and used it to assess the degree of species representation within existing protected areas. Existing protected areas in Spain and Portugal reasonably represented the plant and animal species we considered (73-98%). Nevertheless, species of some groups (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and gymnosperms) did not accumulate in protected areas at a rate higher than expected by chance (p > 0.05). We determined that to conserve all vertebrate and plant species in the Iberian Peninsula, at least 36 additional areas are needed. Selection of additional areas for conservation would be facilitated if such areas coincided with sites of community importance (SCI) designated under the European Commission Habitats Directive. Additional areas required for full representation of the selected plant and animal species all coincide with SCI in Spain. Nevertheless, the degree of coincidence varies between 0.3% and 74.6%, and there is a possibility that important areas for conservation occur outside the SCI. Our results support the view that current SCI can be used for prioritization of areas for conservation, but a systematic reevaluation of conservation priorities in Spain and Portugal would be necessary to ensure that effective conservation of one of European's most important biodiversity regions is achieved.

Biological Conservation	05/01/2017	10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.012	20	Conservation biologists should seek to work with those involved in sustainable agriculture and rural development in expanded integrated approaches to,reduce pesticide harm to humans, biodiversity and environmental services. Despite new evidence, conservation organisations have tended not to fully recognize the impacts of pesticides on biodiversity, and current conservation strategies pay little heed to addressing this threat. A comprehensive suite of strategies are required to reduce and rationalize pesticide use and mitigate risks to species conservation. This paper proposes six steps for conservationists to address pesticide problems: (1) revisit the land sparing versus land sharing debate and include the external impacts of agriculture as vital components in systematic conservation planning; (2) redefine narratives on intensive agriculture and support emerging forms of sustainable intensification; (3) focus and inform on improved delivery mechanisms and monitoring legal use to achieve better pesticide targeting and a major reduction in volumes used; (4) support efforts to reduce wastage and inefficiency in the food system by promoting technical changes and informed consumer choice; (5) design and encourage resilient temperate and tropical landscapes that minimise pesticide contamination on farms and at landscape scale; and (6) develop comprehensive policy responses to promote both better alternatives to synthetic pesticides and limit the use of the most harmful pesticides.

Comptes Rendus Palevol	03/01/2002	NA	9	The new rich vertebrates deposit from the Lower Oligocene, at Vayres-sur-Essonne (Essonne, France), contains 34 marine and seven continental taxa, 17 taxa being recorded for the first time from the Paris Basin. The richness of the ichtyofauna is higher than in anyone of the Parisian Oligocene deposits and equals the one of the 'Argiles de Boom' (Belgian Rupelian). Its affinities with the septentrional ichtyofauna is confirmed, meridional elements being rare. The terrestrial fauna, the oldest known from stratotypical Stampian (base of the Upper Stampian) shares affinities with the one of Montalban and attests the occurrence of nearly freshwater environments.

Environmental & Resource Economics	06/01/2009	10.1007/s10640-008-9226-8	110	This paper is concerned with the empirical relationship between biodiversity conservation values and income. We use random effects panel models to examine the effects of income, and then GDP per capita, on willingness to pay for habitat and biodiversity conservation. In a meta-analysis, 145 Willingness To Pay estimates for biodiversity conservation where existence value plays a major role were collected from 46 contingent valuation studies across six continents. Other effects included in the meta-analysis were the study year; habitat type; continent; scope as presented to respondents; whether WTP bids were for preventing a deterioration or gaining an improvement in conservation, whether a specific species or specific habitat was protected; whether the questionnaire used a dichotomous choice or an open-ended format; distribution format; and the choice of payment vehicle. GDP per capita seemed to perform as well as an explanatory variable as respondent's mean stated income, indicating that it is wealth in society as a whole which determines variations in WTP. Even if large variation, our main conclusion is, that the demand for biodiversity conservation rises with a nation's wealth, but the income elasticity of willingness to pay is less than one.

These reserves were established for a variety of reasons-often unrelated to the protection of biodiversity. In 2000 in response to a growing concern about the lack of organized conservation reserve planning to protect the important threatened biological and physical features of Mexico, the Mexican Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) proposed the establishment of 151 new reserves for Mexico covering 5 1 429,500 ha. We compiled a GIS analysis using digital thematic maps of physical and biological features to examine how the existing and proposed reserves serve to protect the biodiversity and physical features of the country. Using a conservation target of placing a minimum of 12% of the land area of each important biophysical feature in nature reserves, we found that the 144 existing nature reserves covering 18 million ha (9% of the country) only meet that target for elevation ranges > 3000 m and areas with poor soils. These mountainous areas represent less than 12% of the country. The gaps in the existing nature reserves network occur mainly at lower and intermediate elevations ( < 3000 m) areas with xeric, tropical, and temperate ecosystems, and high productivity soils. The areas proposed by CONABIO increase the proportion of protected lands in the country to over 27% and most of the conservation targets for geophysical features, and land cover, categories are met. Whether this area would be sufficient to maintain viable populations and ecological integrity of species and ecosystems is unknown. Even with the new reserves, low elevation coastal lands would be below the conservation target in the nature reserves. To include a representative sample of these lands would be difficult as these are the same areas where the majority of people live. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

4796	WOS:000247203100011	Present forest biodiversity patterns in France related to former Roman agriculture	Ecology	06/01/2007	NA	126	Combined archaeological and ecological investigations in a large ancient oak forest in Central France have revealed a dense network of ancient human settlements dating from the Roman period. We demonstrate a strong correlation between present-day forest plant diversity patterns and the location of Roman farm buildings. Plant species richness strongly increases toward the center of the settlements, and the frequency of neutrophilous and nitrogen-demanding species is higher. This pattern is paralleled by an increase in soil pH, available P, and delta N-15, indicating the long-term impact of former agricultural practices on forest biogeochemical cycles. These extensive observations in a forested region on acid soils complement and confirm previous results from a single Roman settlement on limestone. Ancient Roman agricultural systems are increasingly being identified in contemporary French forests; the broad extent and long-lasting effects of previous cultivation shown in this study require that land-use history be considered as a primary control over biodiversity variations in many forest landscapes, even after millennia of abandonment.

Transformative societal change is required in response. However, while the Global Observing System for Climate has coordinated climate observations for these assessments, there has been no equivalent actor for the biodiversity assessment. Here we argue that a central agency for coordinated biodiversity observations can lead to an improved assessment process for biodiversity status and coupled climate biodiversity observations in areas of mutual interest such as monitoring indicators of Natures Contributions to People. A global biodiversity observation system has already begun to evolve through bottom up development of the Essential Biodiversity Variables. We propose recommendations on how to build on this progress through definition of user requirements, observation principles, creation of a community data basis and regional actions through existing networks.

In this paper, we list spiders from French Guiana from existing literature (with corrected nomenclature when necessary) and from 2142 spiders sampled in 12 sites for this baseline study. Three hundred and sixty four validated species names of spider were found in the literature and previous authors' works. Additional sampling, conducted for this study added another 89 identified species and 62 other species with only a genus name for now. The total species of spiders sampled in French Guiana is currently 515. Many other Morphospecies were found but not described as species yet. An accumulation curve was drawn with seven of the sampling sites and shows no plateau yet. Therefore, the number of species inhabiting French Guiana cannot yet be determined. As the very large number of singletons found in the collected materials suggests, the accumulation curve indicates nevertheless that more sampling is necessary to discover the many unknown spider species living in French Guiana, with a focus on specific periods (dry season and wet season) and on specific and poorly studied habitats such as canopy, inselberg and cambrouze (local bamboo monospecific forest).

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear-a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reducewithin-sample species richness by anaverage of 76.5%, total abundance by 39.5% andrarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strongmitigationcan delivermuchmore positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.

We were able to compare the 1-year old baseline data from permanent plots with the altered species composition after the flood. First, we present a detailed analysis of the baseline biodiversity data as a comparison of the tree and understorey species composition between the late successional and the old forest. We compared the plot community quality aspect-the characteristics of species composition (% geophytes, Illyrian species, presence of vulnerable species, etc.) and the community structure according to biodiversity indicators (S, E, H'). To analyze changes in the understorey after the flood, we calculated species turnover through the Sorensen pairwise dissimilarity index (beta_sor) and investigated differences in species survival and post-flood occurrence changes. In our study, the flood did have an impact on understorey communities, and recovery was slower in the case of the species-poor understorey, with more new species entering the existing species composition, among them alien invasive species. Results suggest that high biodiversity in the under storey forms the basis for better disturbance resilience, with lower mortality and a higher nestedness component for recovery in such an understorey. Our results demonstrate how important it is to maintain high biodiversity in order to sustain the ecological resilience of even small and urban forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mineral soil samples from a grassland were fumigated with chloroform for up to 24 h and then incubated for 5 months to allow recolonisation by surviving organisms. The diversity of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria, protozoa and nematodes was progressively reduced by increasing fumigation times, as was the number of trophic groups, phyla within trophic groups, and taxa within phyla. Total microbial biomass was similar within fumigated soils, but lower than for unfumigated soil. There was no direct relationship between biodiversity and function. Some broad-scale functional parameters increased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. thymidine incorporation, growth on added nutrients, and the decomposition rate of plant residues. Other more specific parameters decreased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. nitrification, denitrification and methane oxidation. Thus specific Functional parameters may be a more sensitive indicator of environmental change than general parameters. Although fumigation reduced soil microbial biodiversity, there was evidence to suggest that it selected for organisms with particular physiological characteristics. The consequences of this for interpreting biodiversity - function relationships are discussed. The stability of the resulting communities to perturbation was further examined by imposing a transient (brief healing to 40 degrees C) or a persistent (addition of CuSO4) stress. Decomposition of grass residues was determined on three occasions after such perturbations. The soils clearly demonstrated resilience to the transient stress; decomposition rates were initially depressed by the stress and recovered over time. Resilience was reduced in the soils with decreasing biodiversity. Soils were not resilient to the persistent stress, there was no recovery in decomposition rate over time, but the soils with the highest biodiversity were more resistant to the stress than soils with impaired biodiversity. The study of functional stability under applied perturbation is a powerful means of examining the effects of biodiversity.

We quantified insect feeding on 3,599 leaves from the speciose Laguna del Hunco flora (Chubut, Argentina), which dates to the early Eocene climatic optimum (52 million years ago) and compared the results with three well preserved, rich, and identically analyzed early- and middle-Eocene floras from the following sites in North America: Republic, WA; Green River, LIT; and Sourdough, WY. We found significantly more damage diversity at Laguna del Hunco than in the North American floras, whether measured on bulk collections or on individual plant species, for both damage morphotypes and feeding groups. An ancient history of rich, specialized plant-insect associations on diverse plant lineages in warm climates may be a major factor contributing to the current biodiversity of South America.

Natural history museums hold specimens that represent the only information available for most species. Ecological niche models (sometimes termed species distributionmodels) combine such information with digital environmental data (especially climatic) to offer key insights for conservation biology, management of invasive species, zoonotic human diseases, and other pressing environmental problems. Five major pitfalls seriously hinder such research, especially for cross-space or cross-time uses: (1) incorrect taxonomic identifications; (2) lacking or inadequate databasing and georeferences; (3) effects of sampling bias across geography; (4) violation of assumptions related to selection of the study region; and (5) problems regarding model evaluation to identify optimal model complexity. Large-scale initiatives regarding data availability and quality, technological development, and capacity building should allow high-quality modeling on a scale commensurate with the enormous potential of and need for these techniques.

Most exotic tree plantations support lower levels of biodiversity and have less potential for ecosystem services supply than natural forests, and differencing them is still a challenge using standard tools. We use a novel approach in south-central of Chile to differentiate tree cover dynamics among natural forests and exotic tree plantations. Chile has one of the world's most competitive forestry industry and the region is a global biodiversity hotspot. Our collaborative visual interpretation method combined a global database of tree cover change, remote sensing from high-resolution satellite images and expert knowledge. By distinguishing exotic tree plantation and natural forest loss, we fit spatially explicit models to estimate tree-cover loss across 40 millions of ha between 2000 and 2016. We were able to distinguish natural forests from exotic tree plantations with an overall accuracy of 99% and predicted forest loss. Total tree cover loss was continuous over time, and the disaggregation revealed that 1 549 909 ha of tree plantations were lost (mean = 96 869 ha year(-1)), while 206 142 ha corresponded to natural forest loss (mean = 12 884 ha year(-1)). Mostly of tree plantations lost returned to be plantation (51%). Natural forests were converted mainly (75%) to transitional land covers (e.g. shrubland, bare land, grassland), and an important proportion of these may finish as tree plantation. This replacement may undermine objectives of increasedcarbon storage and biodiversity. Tree planting as a solution has gained increased attention in recen years with ambitious commitments to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, negative outcomes for the environment could result if strategies incentivize the replacement of natural forests into other land covers. Initiatives to reduce carbon emissions should encourage differentiating natural forests from exotic tree plantations and pay more attention on protecting and managing sustainably the former.

This paper presents the results of ethnobotanical research undertaken in the community of Basihuare in the Sierra Tarahuniara, to provide details on some practical aspects of the Raramuri worldview regarding interconnections between people and their environment. This traditional philosophy forms the basis for the use of edible wild plants and the harvesting strategies practiced in Basihuare, such as selective harvesting, environmental modification and domestication. These activities provide the opportunity for harvesters to monitor the landscape and the plant resources that occur on the land, as well as present a setting for the communication and exchange of traditional ecological knowledge. However, Raramuri harvesting practices are tinder stress because of increased external pressures from commercial timber extraction and other development. We discuss the state of traditional ecological knowledge and its transmission in the context of development activities in the region. The key to sustainability in the Sierra Tarahumara may be the maintenance of traditional management practices for edible wild plants, and other non-timber forest products, that lead to the conservation of biodiversity by creating patchiness and renewing the plant cover on the land.

It is during the mid-late Cretaceous that they evolved into a wide range of morphotypes and were able to colonise a much greater range of environments and regions. During the mid-Cretaceous, in particular, they developed a range of strategies which allowed them to move from eutrophic environments into oligotrophic environments, especially those much deeper in the water column. The general increase and/or turnover of taxa was punctuated by a number of major \""events\"", e.g., the Bonarelli event in the latest Cenomanian.

Insects	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2001	NA	34	Human activities, like logging, modify the dynamics and composition of virgin forest, affecting the equilibrium between the natural species. Nothofagus forests sustain an entomofauna that is endemic, and includes relict species of significant conservation importance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the changes in insect diversity and abundance of a Nothofagus pumilio forest managed by a shelterwood cut system. Insect capture was carried out using a set of traps along a horizontal and vertical gradient. Sampling was taken in day and night conditions, in post-harvesting situations and different phases of stand development. The diversity and abundance of insects varied significantly during the forest cycle (defined as 100-200 years according to site quality). One morphospecies was lost every 11 years until the end of the forest cycle. It may be necessary to modify the current silvicultural system to one that conserves insect diversity through a reduction in disturbance.

The special case of Brittany island mammals	Vie et Milieu-Life and Environment	01/09/1996	NA	6	"In taking the decision whether or not to eradicate the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) from islands off the coast of Brittany in France, some aspects of the general subject of alien species eradication was examined, in an attempt to answer the following question: What is the significance of islands for conservation and restoration of the biodiversity? Can we accept the concept of the \""naturalisation\"" of an alien species, and if so, how do we recognize it? What are the criteria on which we base a decision to eradicate a species in place for a \""long time\""? It appears in conclusion that, as far as we know, the house mouse (Mus musculus), the ship rat (Rattus rattus) and the Norway rat did not reach the coast of Brittany before 3 000, 2 000 and 500 years BP respectively, that is to say, after the last Quaternary transgression which induced the insularity of the Brittany islands. Consequently, their is a great probability that the spread of these species onto Brittany islands was caused by human activity. Moreover, the literature give no evidence that any of these species fills any of the criteria quoted by Usher (1989) and Chapuis et al. (1996) preventing its eradication."

In this work, carried out in the province of Murcia, a representative semi-arid area of the Iberian Peninsula, water beetles were used as indicators to identify the aquatic ecosystems with the highest interest for conservation. For that purpose, an iterative algorithm of complementarity based on the richness of aquatic Coleoptera was applied. 'Complementarity' refers to the degree to which an area, or set of areas, contributes otherwise unrepresented attributes to a set of areas. This principle was used to maximize the number of species represented within a given number of areas. 2. Only the species subsets whose taxonomic status, presence and distribution in the study area are well known were used. In total, 146 species were included, of which 12 are Iberian endemics and 32 are rare species (found only in one grid cell in the study area). 3. The highest correlation was generally shown by species richness with endemic, rare and vulnerable species richness. Thus, basing conservation strategies on species richness appears to be an effective protocol. 4. To preserve the highest degree of biodiversity in the aquatic ecosystems of the study area, the following need to be protected: (a) headwater streams in the north west of the province; (b) the uppermost reaches of the Segura River; (c) hypersaline and coastal ramblas; (d) rock pools and coastal ponds. 5. The present network of Protected Natural Spaces in the study area does not include many of the aquatic ecosystems shown to have the highest biodiversity of beetles. However, the future European 'Natura 2000' network will protect the 10 grid cells of highest aquatic biodiverstity, or at least part of them. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

This high biodiversity of eel species and the wide range of sizes of leptocephali of all families indicated that many species had been spawning during recent months in the region. Leptocephali of the Congridae, Muraenidae, Ophichthidae, Chlopsidae, and Nemichthyidae were the most abundant. All families were widely distributed and there was high species richness and diversity in many areas, suggesting that most taxa of eels were widely distributed throughout the Indonesian Seas. The highest species richness was found in the semi-enclosed Tomini Bay of eastern Sulawesi Island where species diversity was also high at some stations. Anguilla celebesensis Kaup had been spawning in Tomini Bay, but marine eels appeared to have been spawning in most areas. The catch rates of leptocephali varied among areas, with the highest catch rates occurring in Makassar Strait or in Tomini Bay. This first study of the biodiversity of leptocephali in the central Indonesian Seas suggests that many species live in this part of the Indo-Pacific and that eels may be ecologically important components of these high biodiversity ecosystems.

Eight sites in each biotope were selected, which included 530 individuals of phorophytes in dryland forest and 460 in swamp-inundated forest. A total of 148 epiphyte species were recorded, which showed that semi-deciduous rain forests represent a major source of African-epiphyte diversity. Dryland forest hosted 110 epiphyte species, while the swamp-inundated forest harboured 108. A total of 56 species were found only in the dryland forest and 60 were restricted to the swamp-inundated forest. At family level, Orchidaceae exhibited the highest-species richness within both biotopes. Pteridophytes were more abundant in the swamp-inundated forest. A TWINSPAN analysis of the floristic similarities separated the two investigated forest types very clearly. No significant difference existed between the two biotopes regarding vertical distribution of epiphytes within single trees. The swamp-inundated forests may serve as a refuge for many epiphytes that occur in the outer canopy of the dryland forests, both because they are inherently less vulnerable to timber extraction, and enjoy better protection by legislation.

The space available for reserves is limited, however, and conservation efforts must increasingly consider how management of protected areas can promote biodiversity beyond reserve borders. Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity \""spillover'' effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30% of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10-18% more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape-higher edge-to-interior ratio-created by corridors. Corridors promoted biodiversity spillover for native species of the threatened longleaf pine ecosystem being restored in our experiment, but not for exotic species. By extending economically driven spillover concepts from marine fisheries and crop pollination systems, we show how reconnecting landscapes amplifies biodiversity conservation both within and beyond reserve borders."

Location North-eastern Canadian boreal forest (49 degrees 07'-51 degrees 44' N; 70 degrees 13'-65 degrees 15' W). Methods Data on understorey plant communities and habitat factors were collected from 1097 plots. Species co-occurrence was analysed using null model analysis. We derive species groups (i.e. biodiversity deconstruction) using the strength of pairwise species co-occurrences after accounting for random expectation under a null model and cluster analyses. We examine the influence of a set of spatiotemporal environmental variables (overstorey composition, time-since-fire, spatial location and topography) on richness of species groups using Bayesian model averaging, and their relative influence through hierarchical partitioning of variance. Results Understorey plant assemblages were highly structured, with co-occurrence-based classification providing species groups that were coherently aggregated within, but variably segregated between, species groups. Group richness models indicate both common and distinct responses to factors affecting plant succession. For example, Group 2 (e.g. Rhododendron groenlandicum and Cladina rangiferina) showed concurrent contrasting responses to overstorey composition and was strongly segregated from Groups 3 (e.g. Clintonia borealis and Maianthenum canadense) and 4 (e.g. Epilobium angustifolium and Alnus rugosa). Groups 3 and 4 showed partial similarity, but they differed in their response to time-since-fire, drainage and latitude, which were more important for Group 1 (e.g. Ptilium crista-castrensis and Empetrum nigrum). A single successional model based on total richness masked crucial group-level relationships with factors that we examined, such as latitude. Main conclusions By demonstrating the co-occurrence structure and linking to causal factors, the results from this study characterize both common and distinct responses of understorey plants to biophysical attributes of sites, and potential interspecific interactions, behind non-random assemblage structure during post-fire succession. A biodiversity deconstruction approach could offer a concise and explicit framework to gain a better understanding of the complex assembly of ecological communities during succession.

Despite all the efforts over the past 15 years since the Rio Summit, we have seen no improvement in the state of biodiversity; in fact, if anything, the decline has accelerated. The paper argues that problematic institutional incentive structures are an important contributing factor that aggravates biodiversity crisis worldwide. In this, countries do differ from each other, but in essence biodiversity loss has become more severe because of the empty status function for biodiversity and the organised irresponsibility allowed by erroneous natural resources policies not able to reasonably and efficiently address the interlinkedness of human and ecological systems. The paper uses Finland, Peru, and Russia as examples. The paper concludes by offering an explanatory hypothesis how slowly acknowledged significance of ecosystem functions and, consequently, ecosystem approach is initiating changes in the governance principles of forest resources in these three countries - and why.

It has been proposed to include this area in the Natura 2000 network due to the wide range of species and habitats of high conservation value found here, such as Posidonia oceanica meadows and maA << rl and coralligenous beds. This study aimed to establish a scientific basis for managing and protecting the continental shelf bottoms in Menorca Channel. Sampling was carried out with side-scan sonar, beam trawls, box corers, a remote-operated vehicle and an underwater drop camera. The information collected was used to map the habitat distribution between 50 and 100 m depth, as well as make an inventory and describe the spatial patterns of both the specific and functional diversity. A total of 636 species was recorded in a mosaic of habitats in which Corallinacea calcareous algae and other soft red algae (Osmundaria volubilis and Peyssonnelia spp.) were the most abundant groups. Hotspots of specific and functional diversity were located in areas with high habitat heterogeneity and complexity. Protection of Menorca Channel should not only include the habitats and species in the European directives, but also the habitats that are not currently protected, such as O. volubilis and Peyssonnelia beds, due to their biogeographical and ecological interest and their contribution to the biodiversity of shelf bottoms in the Mediterranean Sea.

However, with the current global financial crisis, governments are increasingly trying to stabilise economies through spending cuts aiming to reduce national deficits. Within such an economic climate, the devolution of governance through public participation is an intrinsically appealing concept. We outline a number of challenges that explain why increased participation in biodiversity management has been and may continue to be problematic. Using as a case study the local stakeholder-driven Moray Firth Seal Management Plan in Scotland, we identify four key conditions that were crucial to the successful participatory management of a biodiversity conflict: a local champion, the emergence of a crisis point, the involvement of decision-makers, and long-term financial and institutional support. Three of the four conditions point to the role of direct government involvement, highlighting the risk of devolving responsibility for biodiversity conflict management to local communities. We argue that without an informed debate, the move towards a more participatory approach could pose a danger to hard-won policy gains in relation to public participation, biodiversity conservation and conflict management.

4217	WOS:000305462900002	Biodiversity and community structure of Late Pleistocene foraminifera from Kish Island, Persian Gulf (Iran)	Facies	01/07/2012	10.1007/s10347-011-0286-9	6	The raised coral reef sequences at Kish Island provide a rare window into the depositional setting and paleoenvironment of a high-latitude, shallow-water coral reef that developed under turbid conditions in the Persian Gulf during Marine Isotope Stage 7 (similar to 200 to 250 ka). Six sedimentary facies and eight foraminiferal assemblages can be identified throughout the sequence. A ninth assemblage can be defined for the modern subtidal realm. At the base of the sequence is a marl rich in hyaline foraminifera (Elphidium, Ammonia, Asterorotalia, Bulimina, Nonion, and Quinqueloculina) and ostracods, which was deposited in about 30-40 m water depth in a turbid deltaic setting. Shallowing resulted in the marl becoming sandy, and changing to a mollusc-rich facies with rare foraminifera (mostly smaller miliolid taxa) that formed the substrate for coral recruitment. The coral marl layer contains many large corals embedded in situ in an aggregate and coralline algae-rich marl. Two abundance peaks in the foraminifera occur at the base and mid-way through this layer, which also correspond to a change from Murrayinella-dominated to Placopsilina-dominated assemblages, indicating deepening and more open-marine conditions, but elevated turbidity. Towards the top of the layer, abundance of foraminifera decreases and miliolid foraminifera become dominant. The top-most layer is dominated by coral and mollusc fragments and has an Amphistegina-rich reef-related assemblage. Of the Late Pleistocene foraminiferal assemblages, the Murrayinella-, Pararotalia-, and Placopsilina-dominated assemblages are no longer present in the modern gulf for unknown reasons. Of the other five assemblages, only the Amphistegina assemblage is found within proximity to the modern Kish Island. The Elphidium and Asterorotalia-Bulimina assemblages are from deeper areas of the gulf. The Ammonia and Quinqueloculina assemblages occur in lagoonal sediments on the Arabian side of the gulf. Like the modern Persian Gulf, the diversity of foraminifera was low (similar to 80 common species) during the Pleistocene and does not correlate with foraminiferal abundance.

Furthermore, over the last couple of years, the need for the integration of other kinds of knowledge (experience based or indigenous knowledge) is increasingly acknowledged. For instance, the incorporation of such knowledge is indispensable for place-based approaches to sustainable land management, which require that the specific ecological and social context is addressed. However, desirable as it may be, such an engagement of the holders of tacit knowledge is not easy to achieve. It demands reconciling well-established scientific procedural standards with the implicit or explicit criteria of relevance that apply in civil society a process that typically causes severe tensions and comes up against both habitual as well as institutional constraints. The difficulty of managing such tensions is amplified particularly in large integrated projects and represents a major challenge to project management. At the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, several integrated research projects have been conducted over the past years in which experience has been gained with these specific challenges. This paper presents some of the lessons learned from large integrated projects, with an emphasis on project design and management structure. At the centre of the present contribution are experiences gained in the coordination and management of LEGATO (LEGATO stands for Land-use intensity and Ecological EnGineering - Assessment Tools for risks and Opportunities in irrigated rice based production systems, see www.legato-project.net), an ongoing, large-scale, inter- and transdisciplinary research project dealing with the management of irrigated rice landscapes in Southeast Asia. In this project, local expertise on traditional production systems is absolutely crucial but needs to be integrated with natural and social science research to identify future-proof land management systems.

5973	WOS:000346375400089	Future of Endemic Flora of Biodiversity Hotspots in India	Plos One	12/12/2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0115264	34	India is one of the 12 mega biodiversity countries of the world, which represents 11% of world's flora in about 2.4% of global land mass. Approximately 28% of the total Indian flora and 33% of angiosperms occurring in India are endemic. Higher human population density in biodiversity hotspots in India puts undue pressure on these sensitive eco-regions. In the present study, we predict the future distribution of 637 endemic plant species from three biodiversity hotspots in India; Himalaya, Western Ghats, Indo-Burma, based on A1B scenario for year 2050 and 2080. We develop individual variable based models as well as mixed models in MaxEnt by combining ten least co-related bioclimatic variables, two disturbance variables and one physiography variable as predictor variables. The projected changes suggest that the endemic flora will be adversely impacted, even under such a moderate climate scenario. The future distribution is predicted to shift in northern and northeastern direction in Himalaya and Indo-Burma, while in southern and south-western direction in Western Ghats, due to cooler climatic conditions in these regions. In the future distribution of endemic plants, we observe a significant shift and reduction in the distribution range compared to the present distribution. The model predicts a 23.99% range reduction and a 7.70% range expansion in future distribution by 2050, while a 41.34% range reduction and a 24.10% range expansion by 2080. Integration of disturbance and physiography variables along with bioclimatic variables in the models improved the prediction accuracy. Mixed models provide most accurate results for most of the combinations of climatic and non-climatic variables as compared to individual variable based models. We conclude that a) regions with cooler climates and higher moisture availability could serve as refugia for endemic plants in future climatic conditions; b) mixed models provide more accurate results, compared to single variable based models.

Some of these properties may be mediated by its fungal endophytes. This study analyzed, for the first time, the community of endophytic fungi of C. procera outside its region of origin. A total of 156 fungal isolates distributed across 19 taxa were obtained from 468 fragments of C. procera leaves at different stages of maturation. The rate of endophyte colonization increased with the leaf age/development. The dominant species of endophytic fungi of C. procera introduced in Northeast Brazil were different from those found in studies on the same species and other species of the same genus in native regions. The dominant endophyte was Phaeoramularia calotropidis (63.5 %), followed by Guignardia bidwellii (21.1 %). Six isolates of endophytic fungi showed antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic micro-organisms and one plant pathogenic fungus. The antibacterial activity was more intense than the antifungal activity. The endophytic Curuularia pallescens (URM 6048) stood out inhibited Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyo genes, the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum dematium. Ecological and biotechnological aspects of endophytic mycota are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.	Nascimento, T. L. ; Oki, Y. ; Lima, D. M.

While the scale dependence of diversity estimation has received substantial attention, the scale dependence of disturbance estimation has been essentially overlooked. Here, we break from conventional examination of the diversity-disturbance relationship by holding the area over which species richness is estimated constant and instead manipulating the area over which human disturbance is measured. In the boreal forest ecoregion of Alberta, Canada, we test the dependence of species richness on disturbance scale, the scale-dependence of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and the consistency of these patterns in native versus exotic species and among human disturbance types. We related field observed species richness in 1 ha surveys of 372 boreal vascular plant communities to remotely sensed measures of human disturbance extent at two survey scales: local (1 ha) and landscape (18 km(2)). Supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, species richness-disturbance relationships were quadratic at both local and landscape scales of disturbance measurement. This suggests the shape of richness-disturbance relationships is independent of the scale at which disturbance is assessed, despite that local diversity is influenced by disturbance at different scales by different mechanisms, such as direct removal of individuals (local) or indirect alteration of propagule supply (landscape). By contrast, predictions of species richness did depend on scale of disturbance measurement: with high local disturbance richness was double that under high landscape disturbance.

Trading biodiversity using offsets is rapidly becoming part of the resulting push for market governance that is promoted as a more efficient means of Nature conservation. In critically evaluating this position I argue that offsets, along with biodiversity and ecosystem valuation, use economic logic to legitimise, rather than prevent, ongoing habitat destruction. Biodiversity offsets provide a means of commodifying habitat for exchange. They operationalise trade-offs that are in the best interests of developers and make false claims to adding productive new economic activity. Contrary to the argument that economic logic frees conservation from ethics, I expose the ethical premises required for economists to justify public policy support for offsets. Finally, various issues in offset design are raised and placed in the context of a political struggle over the meaning of Nature. The overall message is that, if conservationists continue down the path of conceptualising the world as in mainstream economics they will be forced from one compromise to another, ultimately losing their ability to conserve or protect anything. They will also be abandoning the rich and meaningful human relationships with Nature that have been their raison d'etre. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We link population genetic processes of selection and adaptation to speciation and extinction by way of their interaction with environmental factors to drive global scale macroecological patterns. High-latitude regions are both cradle and grave with respect to species diversification. In particular, we point to a conceptual equivalence of \""environmental harshness\"" and \""hard selection\"" as eco-evolutionary drivers of local adaptation and ecological speciation. By describing how ecological speciation likely occurs more readily at high latitudes, with such nascent species especially prone to extinction by fusion, we derive the ephemeral ecological speciation hypothesis as an integrative mechanistic explanation for latitudinal gradients in species turnover and the net accumulation of biodiversity."

There have been no peer-reviewed multinational assessments concerning the actual implementation of NNL policies to date. Such assessments would facilitate more informed debates on the validity of NNL for conservation, but assessing implementation requires data. Here, we explore data transparency concerning NNL implementation, with four European countries providing a case study. Biodiversity offsets (offsets) are the most tangible outcome of NNL policy. Using an expert network to locate all offset datasets available within the public domain, we collated information on offset projects implemented in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Implementation data for offsets were found to be non-transparent, but the degree of transparency varies widely by country. We discuss barriers preventing data transparency - including a perceived lack of necessity, lack of common protocols for collecting data, and a lack of resources to do so. For the data we collected we find that most offsets in Europe: are not within protected areas; involve active restoration; and, compensate for infrastructure development. The area occupied by European offsets is at least of the order similar to 10(2) km(2). Transparent national NNL databases are essential for meeting good practice NNL principles, but are not currently available in Europe. We discuss what such databases might require to support evaluation of NNL policy effectiveness by researchers, the conservation community and policymakers.

Agriculture's influence on humanity is a dichotomy of promise and peril. Research on the food-environment dilemma has highlighted the environmental consequences of food production, yet the identification of management solutions is an ongoing challenge. 2. We suggest \""bright spots\"" as a promising tool to identify levers of change by finding areas that exceed expectations for goals, such as agricultural landscape multifunctionality and biodiversity. 3. We identified bright, dark and average spots within a complex agricultural landscape and explored the associated socioeconomic patterns. We found that areas exceeding expectations for biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality were neither spatially congruent nor in conflict. It was more common for areas to underperform (dark spots) for both biodiversity and multifunctionality than over perform for both (bright spots). 4. While dark spots for multifunctionality were alike in their ecosystem service composition, bright spots were bright in multiple, diverse ways. The socioeconomic attributes that characterize bright and darks spots included both farm characteristics as well as farming practices, suggesting that both have potential to be levers of change. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that while biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality show similar spatial patterns due to underlying biophysical drivers, managing for biodiversity or landscape multifunctionality alone will not implicitly achieve the other in this system. Bright spots (areas exceeding expectations) in multifunctionality were associated with many different combinations of ecosystem services, but dark spots were uniquely agricultural intensive areas devoted to maximizing crop production at the expense of all other services. From a management perspective, specific farm characteristics and farming practices may impact the potential for multifunctionality: increased mechanization, increased agricultural inputs and larger farm size and capital were associated with dark spots, while smaller farms with potentially greater space for innovation were associated with bright spots."

Predicting their response to future climate scenarios is critical to their conservation, but ecological models are based only on short-term observations. The fossil record provides the only empirical evidence for the long-term response of organisms under perturbed climate states. The palaeontological record from the Last Interglacial (LIG; 125 000 years ago), a time of global warming, suggests that reef corals experienced poleward range shifts and an equatorial decline relative to their modern distribution. However, this record is spatio-temporally biased, and existing methods cannot account for data absence. Here, we use ecological niche modelling to estimate reef corals' realized niche and LIG distribution, based on modern and fossil occurrences. We then make inferences about modelled habitability under two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Reef coral ranges during the LIG were comparable to the present, with no prominent equatorial decrease in habitability. Reef corals are likely to experience poleward range expansion and large equatorial declines under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, this range expansion is probably optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate change. Incorporation of fossil data in niche models improves forecasts of biodiversity responses under global climatic change.

Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development from Rio to Rio+20	01/01/2014	10.1163/9789004282919_008	0	In the year marking the 20th anniversary of the taking of effect of the Convention on Biological Diversity, support for which was reiterated by the signatory States in the Rio+ 20 Declaration, it appears to be time to review the current situation. The review must examine the progress made on each of the Convention's objectives : conservation, sustainable use and access, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. These objectives, which are not hierarchized in the Convention and can be contradictory, are difficult to implement in the current era of globalization. A cross- comparison of these issues with the two themes for the Rio+ 20 Conference, the green economy and the institutional framework for sustainable development, raises a number of questions. The green economy theme points to the need to question the possibilities for, and limits on, the introduction of biodiversity into the marketplace, and places developed and developing nations at odds with each other, since the latter fear the risks of a commodification of nature and the imposition of new obligations and conditions on their countries. The institutional framework for sustainable development theme leads to a debate about the role of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services (ipbes) and the opportunities it offers for strengthening the existing scientific and political interfaces for biodiversity and ecosystem services, since their currently fragmented and uncoordinated state creates an obstacle for decisions in the biodiversity field.

But on the other hand, the utilization of the river waters in domestic, agriculture, industry and other essential purposes is also equally important and is being used by conserving the in-flow waters through the constructions of dams, barrages, weirs etc. Further, when the conservation of water in rivers becomes excessive, the inflow of water gets reduced and affects the biodiversity drastically. The present communication details how the biodiversity of river Mahanadi system has been affected after the construction of a number of dams, barrages, weirs etc at the upper stretches of the river.

In this study we assessed the structure and biological traits of macrofaunal assemblages from 24 south-east Queensland mudflats in order to determine whether ecological functioning (e.g. primary production, nutrient cycling) and the delivery of ecosystem services was affected by urbanisation. This work represents the most comprehensive assessment of mudflat assemblages in the region to date. The mudflats contained 50 macrofaunal taxa and so were comparable to other local intertidal systems. Summer assemblages contained more species, more individuals and had differing taxonomic composition. When indexed as a proportion of subcatchment area, urbanisation did not correspond to a clear impact on macrofaunal composition; rather, the nature of the industry or activity was critical. Mudflats from subcatchments with industries producing organic wastes significantly differed from subcatchments with <1.3% cover of these industries. Functioning was conserved in mudflats experiencing current levels of enrichment, but this may decline with growing pressure from human populations. The results of this study illustrate that large-scale spatial data, such as from satellites, can be used to detect the cumulative effects of urbanisation when the pressures are highly resolved.

One factor that is suggested to be important in determining community structure is productivity, which is related to diversity. Though this relationship might depend on different factors, a hump-shaped, U-shaped or positive linear relationship seems to be frequent at the local scale. On the other hand, the concept of metacommunity considers how several communities are linked through dispersal. Here, we experimentally assessed how primary producer biomass and dispersal barriers drive diversity at the local scale in Mediterranean streams. We did this by creating a reach scale study system that resembled a metacommunity. We found that higher primary producer biomass promotes a saturating relationship with diversity. However, we did not detect any effect of the dispersal barriers on the responses. Thus, our results show that, at the local scale, patch primary producer biomass plays a more important role in determining the community structure and colonization than dispersal barriers. In the framework of metacommunity theory, our study system can be explained by combining assumptions of the \""Mass-Effects\"" and the \""Species-Sorting\"" archetypes, supporting a non-exclusive view of these hypotheses."

To understand marine ecosystem responses to increasing nutrient disturbances, we implemented field mesocosm experiments to study phytoplankton community structure and biodiversity responses to nutrient treatments with nitrate, phosphate and iron across tropical seas. Our results showed that DIN supply would change phytoplankton community structure and stimulated the regime shift from cyanobacteria to diatoms (relative dominance R > 0). Phytoplankton communities were dominated by diatoms (relative abundance > 50%) accompanied by high chlorophyll a content with 1.58-39.27 mu g.L-1 in DIN-added cultures, whereas cyanobacteria dominated communities (relative abundance > 60%) with low biomass of 0.12-0.18 mu g.L-1 in undisturbed cultures. Simultaneously increased DIN loading from atmospheric deposition would decrease ecological diversity of tropical seas owing to species competition and succession (Shannon diversity H' decreased to < 1).

Four oceanographic cruises, covering 93 stations in three different seasons during 2007 and 2008 were carried out to quantify species richness and abundance, as well as to analyse the distribution of these cnidarians. We identified 20 species of hydromedusae and one siphonophore, increasing the total number of hydromedusae for the area to 23. This value is similar to the one found in the abutting Argentine continental shelf (20), but with a different assemblage composition. Hydromedusae abundances found were low, except for a bloom of the Leptomedusa Obelia spp. during the cold season. The only siphonophore found in the area, Pyrostephos vanhoeffeni, has previously been thought to be endemic to Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters, this being the first record for temperate waters of the Southwest Atlantic Ocean.

One of the most invasive species in this group is the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852). In addition to other characteristics facilitating its invasiveness, it is also a vector of crayfish plague, a disease mostly lethal to crayfish of non-North American origin. Procambarus clarkii, at present the most widespread crayfish species globally, is popular in many countries both for human consumption and as an ornamental animal. An established population of this species was documented for the first time within Indonesia, representing the first record for maritime Southeast Asia. The species is also common in the local ornamental pet trade. Infection by the crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci Schikora was confirmed both in the outdoor population of P. clarkii and in one of the surveyed pet shops. Furthermore, A. astaci was detected in specimens of freshwater crab and shrimp species coexisting with P. clarkii. Local climatic conditions and the species temperature requirements suggest a high probability of the establishment of P. clarkii in Indonesia. Its further spread could irreversibly damage populations of many native endemic crustaceans in the country (as well as elsewhere in the region), and the thriving local aquacultures of the redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (von Martens, 1868) may also be threatened. The total ban of P. clarkii and other crayfish species of North American origin in Indonesia is strongly recommended, especially considering that aquaculture and trade with Australasian species is a viable alternative option.

The ponds were originally created to provide a variety of societal services (irrigation, visual amenity, water for cattle, etc.). We also assessed the environmental factors influencing invertebrate assemblages in these ponds. Only 18 invertebrate taxa out of 114 taxa occurring in the study area were common to ponds and rivers indicating that the contribution of farm ponds to freshwater biodiversity was potentially high. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM, neural network) was used to classify 36 farm ponds in terms of the 52 invertebrate families and genera they supported, and to specify the influence of environmental variables related to land-use and to pond characteristics on the assemblage patterns. The SOM trained with taxa occurrences showed five clusters of ponds, most taxa occurring only in 1-2 clusters of ponds. Abandoned ponds tended to support higher numbers of taxa, probably because they were allowed to undergo a natural succession. Nevertheless, abandoned ponds were also amongst the largest, so that it remained difficult to separate the effects of pond size and abandonment, although both factors were likely to interact to favour higher taxon richness. The invertebrate communities in the ponds appeared to be influenced mainly by widely acting environmental factors (e.g. area, regionalization of assemblages) with little evidence that pond use (e.g. cattle watering, amenity) generally influenced assemblage composition. Our results support the idea that agricultural landscapes containing man-made ponds make a significant contribution to freshwater biodiversity indicating that protection of farm ponds from threats such as in-filling and pollution can make a positive contribution to the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. This added value for biodiversity should be considered when calculating the economic costs and benefits of constructing water bodies for human activities.

Anecdotal evidence indicates crowdfunding is being used to support activities needed for biodiversity conservation, yet its magnitude and allocation remain largely unknown. To help address this knowledge gap, we conducted a global analysis based on conservation-focused projects extracted from crowdfunding platforms. For each project, we determined the funds raised, date, country of implementation, proponent characteristics, activity type, biodiversity realm, and target taxa. We identified 72 relevant platforms and 577 conservation-focused projects that raised $4,790,634 since 2009. Although proponents were based in 38 countries, projects were delivered across 80 countries, indicating a potential mechanism of resource mobilization. Proponents were affiliated with nongovernmental organizations (35%) or universities (30%) or were freelancers (26%). Most projects were for research (40%), persuasion (31%), and on-the-ground actions (21%). Projects were more focused on species (57.7%) and terrestrial ecosystems (20.3%), and less focused on marine (8.8%) and freshwater ecosystems (3.6%). Projects focused on 208 species, including a disproportionate number of threatened birds and mammals. Crowdfunding for biodiversity conservation is a global phenomenon and there is potential for expansion, despite possible pitfalls (e.g., uncertainty about effectiveness). Opportunities to advance conservation through crowdfunding arise from its capacity to mobilize funds spatially and increase steadily over time, inclusion of overlooked species, adoption by multiple actors, and funding of activities beyond research. Our findings pave the way for further research on key questions, such as campaign success rates, effectiveness of conservation actions, and drivers of crowdfunding adoption. Even though crowdfunding capital raised has been modest relative to other conservation-finance mechanisms, its contribution goes beyond funding research and providing capital. Embraced with due care, crowdfunding could become an important financial mechanism for biodiversity conservation.

After a history of commercial exploitation the mangroves along the Klong Ngao tidal creek have been assigned conservation status within a new Ranong Biosphere Reserve established in 1997. Over the past 12 years, several areas of mangrove destroyed or degraded by wood harvesting, tin mining and aquaculture, have been rehabilitated on a pilot basis by planting monocultures of mangrove seedlings using four common local species (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Bruguiera cyclindrica and Ceriops tagal). These plantation forests with different past management histories were compared with a natural, mixed, mature mangrove forest which has been conserved for about 40 years. Macrofauna were sampled within a 100 m(2) vegetation quadrat in each study site. Crustaceans were sampled quantitatively by 3 x 15 min timed hand catches per site. Molluscs were sampled in 3 x m(2) quadrats positioned around three randomly selected trees in each vegetation quadrat. The lowest crustacean and molluscan diversity was recorded from the former tin mining site. The highest diversity was recorded from a Rhizophora plantation in the natural mixed forest area for both crustaceans and molluscs. The vegetation community structure was not correlated with the environmental variables measured, or with macrofauna community structure. Of the environmental parameters chosen, the crustacean community structure was best expressed by shore level, while for molluscan diversity and abundance it was soil moisture content. The macrofauna community structure at the tin mining site was significantly different to the other sites, and was dominated by a single species of crab, Metaplax elegans. Grapsid crabs, especially sesarmid species, dominated over ocypodid crabs in the mature forest site, whereas Uca species and other ocypodids were more abundant than grapsids in the degraded concession forest area. Snails of the families Neritidae and Ellobiidae were the most abundant molluscs in the mature forest, whereas Littoriinidae, Assimineidae and Potamidae species were more representative of the younger plantation sites. The findings from this study suggest that some of these well represented families of mangrove macrofauna could be used as indicators of ecological change as part of a long term environmental monitoring programme in Ranong and other areas in Southeast Asia where mangroves are being rehabilitated.

Material was collected by SCUBA diving, by totally scraping off five replicate quadrates (400 cm(2) each) at three depth levels (15, 30, 40 in) from six sites located in Chalkidiki peninsula, plus one in Kavala Gulf. The examination of the 19,343 living specimens collected revealed the presence of 314 species. Though the multivariate analyses showed high similarity between stations, the structure of this sciaphilic algal community seems to have an increased spatial heterogeneity. Four distinct facies were recorded in accordance with the occurrence of different algal forms, the degree of hard substrate inclination and the water clarity. A short review on the biodiversity of sublittoral communities in the Mediterranean revealed the affinity between the western and the eastern basin and also among the photophilic and the sciaphilic algal communities.

Stream biofilms were subjected to a pesticide mix (diuron and azoxystrobin) under two different hydraulic regimes. The hydraulic regimes differed by spatial variations of flow conditions (turbulent with high variations vs. laminar with low variations). The effects of the hydraulic regime and pesticides were assessed at the level of the periphytic communities. We focused on the change in the biodiversity of these communities under the two hydraulic regimes, and on the role of these biodiversity changes in case of pesticide contamination. Changes in structural (biomass, cell density), diversity (community composition assessed by PCR-DGGE and microscopic analysis) and functional (bacterial and algal production, sensitivity to the herbicide) parameters were monitored throughout a 2-month experiment. The results showed that exposure to pesticides affected the phytobenthic community targeted by the herbicide, impacting on both its growth dynamics and its primary production. Conversely, the impact of the flow regime was greater than that of pesticides on the non-target bacterial community with higher bacterial density and production in laminar mesocosms (uniform regime). An interaction between flow and pollution effects was also observed. Communities that developed in turbulent mesocosms (heterogeneous regime) were more diversified, as a result of increased microhabitat heterogeneity due to high spatial variations. However, this higher biodiversity did not increase the ability of these biofilms to tolerate pesticides, as expected. On the contrary, the sensitivity of these communities to pesticide contamination was, in fact, increased. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is located within a wider 'impact neutrality' context where such offsetting measures are increasingly being advanced. The literature on compensatory habitat, some of which relates to site-specific measures and some to habitat 'banking', is considered in order to map how compensatory measures may be prone to failure. This is done against the criteria of functionality, proponent bias, monitoring and enforceability, and economic influence. These are then used to evaluate the Commission's opinions under the Directive. While the compensation obligation is to be applauded, the Commission's opinions fare poorly against all these criteria, a common, and important, thread being a lack of transparency. This calls into question the wider compensatory aspects of the legislation.

Although around the island of Sylt in the North Sea, the small zoobenthos (meiofauna) has been studied intensively since the 1950s, repeating previous surveys revealed an unexpected wealth of new species in addition to the 330 species of free-living microturbellarians (non-parasitic Platyhelminthes) already known from this area. Extrapolation from well-known to less-known habitat types suggests that a total of some 520 Platyhelminth species should be expected around this island, about 670 in the North Sea ecoregion, and 830 in the Northern European Sea' ecoprovince. Assuming that the other biogeographic provinces of the planet harbour a similar diversity, a total of some 20,000 marine microturbellarian species is estimated for the global shelf zones. Less than 10% of these are known by now. As a contribution to fill that gap, ten new taxa are described: Coelogynopora minuta n. sp., Coelogynopora sopottehlersae n. sp., Cirrifera paraculeata n. sp., Boreocelis fragilis n. sp., Postbursoplana noldti n. sp., Promesostoma wehrenbergi n. sp., Ptyalorhynchus oculatus n. sp., Acrorhynchides canaliculatus n. sp., Dactyloplana n. gen., and Dactyloplana tridigitata n. sp.

Unfortunately, complementarity in biodiversity across all groups cannot usually be measured directly, so methods are needed to choose good surrogates (or 'indicators') for predicting this overall complementarity. Previous attempts at assessment of biological surrogates have measured dissimilarity among biotas, or congruence between sets of selected areas, or species representation within a set of selected areas, all of which can seriously misrepresent the strength of a surrogate relationship across all areas. Therefore, we propose a new approach to complementarity analysis. We show that the pattern of complementarity among all biotas can be assessed in terms of the frequency of false high and false low predictions by the surrogates. We also show how the spatial pattern in these false predictions can be mapped and discuss their usefulness. On the one hand, areas on these maps associated with many false high predictions are overvalued and would be an inefficient investment for scarce conservation resources. On the other hand, areas associated with many false low predictions are under-valued and unlikely to attract conservation action, so we need to know whether they are particularly likely to be highly threatened. These geographical patterns can be used to identify habitat-associated biases in the performance of surrogate groups. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We were looking for ways and values that could be used to promote conservation in this region through the adoption of sustainable land-use practices which have human welfare benefits. Our study adopted a variety of methods in valuing these services in developing ranges of values for these services. At the biome level, total annual values ranged from $ 19-114 million for grazing, $ 2-$ 20 million for tourism, and $ 300-3120 million for water. These values are generally low compared with values derived for other biomes and regions and do not adequately reflect known dependence and the importance of ecosystem services to the residents of this biome. The ecosystems here provide small but critical benefits enabling communities to sustain themselves and small changes in service levels can have major welfare effects. Highlighting these sensitivities will require finding more appropriate ways to link ecological and social factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	O'Farrell, P. J. ; De Lange, W.

It is located within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and is contained within the recently established Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. In 2000, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Systematics Laboratory began an exploratory trawling program to document nekton diversity at BSM and its vicinity. Here, we summarize eight exploratory sampling cruises conducted between 2000 and 2014, and describe the cephalopod biodiversity and assemblage structure around BSM. Over the course of 174 deep-midwater and 56 bottom tows, 5088 cephalopods were identified, measured, and documented. In total, 77 species were collected at BSM; 75 species were collected from midwater tows and 28 from benthic tows. Rarefaction curves did not reach an asymptote, suggesting that additional sampling will collect more species. Seventeen species accounted for 75% of the total midwater and bottom catch, including: Illex illecebrosus (n = 605), Magnoteuthis magna (n = 568), Abraliopsis morisii (n = 518), Abralia redfieldi (n = 358), Mastigoteuthis agassizii (n = 336), Histioteuthis reversa (n = 273), Taonius pavo (n = 239), Haliphron atlanticus (n = 195), Brachioteuthis beanii (n = 160), Ornithoteuthis antillarum (n = 153), Pterygioteuthis gemmata (n = 141), Pyroteuthis margaritifera (n = 120), Vampyroteuthis infernalis (n = 101), Chiroteuthis veranyi (n = 33), Bolitaena pygmaea (n = 30), Graneledone verrucosa (n = 11), and Stauroteuthis syrtensis (n = 29). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of significant analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) results showed that the 2000 cruise was different from other years, meteorological winter was different from other seasons, and that day and night shallow samples were different from each other and all other depths. Based on seasonal size variation in the most abundant taxa, we propose hypotheses of year-round, winter, and spring spawning for future critical assessment. This extensive description of the offshore cephalopod assemblage may be used to assess vulnerability to future environmental changes and human activities.

Although adaptive management offers a promising approach to overcome scientific uncertainty, normative uncertainty is seldom tackled by conservation science. We expanded on the approach proposed by adaptive-management theorists by devising an integrative and iterative approach to conservation that encompasses both types of uncertainty. Inspired by environmental pragmatism, we suggest that moral values at stake in biodiversity conservation are plastic and that a plurality of individual normative positions can coexist and evolve. Moral values should thus be explored through an experimental process as additional parameters to be incorporated in the traditional adaptive-management approach. As such, moral values should also be monitored by environmental ethicists working side by side with scientists and managers on conservation projects. Acknowledging the diversity of moral values and integrating them in a process of collective deliberation will help overcome the normative uncertainty. We used Dewey's distinction between adaptation and adjustment to offer a new paradigm built around what we call adjustive management, which reflects both the uncertainty and the likely evolution of the moral values humans attribute to biodiversity. We illustrate how this paradigm relates to practical conservation decisions by exploring the case of the Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), an alien species in France that is the target of an eradication plan undertaken with little regard for moral issues. We propose that a more satisfying result of efforts to control Sacred Ibis could have been reached by rerouting the traditional feedback loop of adaptive management to include a normative inquiry. This adjustive management approach now needs to be tested in real-case conservation programs.

They improve water quality by retaining nutrients and sediment from through-flowing water, sequester carbon and attenuate flood peaks at high discharge. At the same time, they have been shown to enhance biodiversity at the landscape as well as regional scale. However, there is concern about loss of biodiversity and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions where wetlands have become overloaded with nutrient-rich surface water or groundwater. This paper discusses conditions for the best performance of riparian zones and other small wetlands in agricultural landscapes in terms of nutrient and greenhouse gas retention and biodiversity. High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5. Such conditions occur mostly in stream headwater areas only where sandy sediments have a low buffering capacity, whereas higher-order streams and their riparian zones often have fine silty clay or loam sediments with higher pH values, supporting effective denitrification with low nitrous oxide emission. The question whether the nutrient attenuation service comes at the expense of biodiversity losses should be answered differently for existing, (semi-)natural wetlands and for new wetlands created in the agricultural landscape. Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species. Wetlands in riparian zones are naturally more nutrient-rich and can tolerate much higher nutrient loadings without consequences for ecosystem health and diversity, their loading limits are 50 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4 g P m(-2) y(-1). For nitrogen the relatively high limit is explained by significant denitrification activities in wetlands, transforming nitrate to mostly inert elemental nitrogen gas. There are also indications that only one of the major nutrients needs to be in short supply (i.e. below the limits indicated) in order to avoid major eutrophication problems. In agricultural areas where large numbers of wetlands have been created for N removal and biodiversity enhancement, the experience of this 'dual purpose' are generally positive, particularly in landscapes where not much of the original wetland resource remains.

Governments and nonprofit organizations alike are gaining increased appreciation for the contributions of intact ecosystems to water security, whereas conservation scientists call for decisive action to address the dire condition of earth's freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. Stakeholder-based, Habermasian decision-making frameworks such as integrated water resources management (IWRM) are widely used to equitably manage complex water systems, and ecologists have developed increasingly sophisticated frameworks (e.g., environmental flows) to quantify and anticipate the ecological outcomes of water management decisions. IWRM implementation is criticized for being excessively top-down whereas ecological frameworks in water decision-making can fail to account for the cultural and societal values of ecosystems, and it remains unclear how best to connect the desired bottom-up implementation of IWRM with the expert-based, top-down structure of hydro-ecological research. We revisit and elaborate upon the ecological stakeholder analog (ESA) concept, which treats ecological phenomena (e.g., species and processes) as stakeholders and ecological information as interests and positions with respect to water management. We then illustrate how ESAs can address the many calls to improve environmental flows and IWRM strategies by improving their integration, and how established conceptual frameworks from stakeholder theory applies readily to ecological stakeholders.	van Rees, Charles B. ; Canizares, Jessica Rozek ; Garcia, Gabriela Marie ; Reed, J.

Here, instead of taking a multivariate approach, we further develop the sampling theory of Hubbell's neutral spatially implicit theory and derive simple abundance distributions for a random sample both from a local community and a metacommunity. Our result is given in terms of the average number of species with a given abundance in any randomly extracted sample. Contrary to what has been widely assumed, a random sample from a metacommunity is not fully described by the Fisher log-series, but by a new distribution. This new sample distribution matches the log-series expectation at high biodiversity values (theta > 1) but clearly departs from it for species-poor metacommunities (theta < 1). Our theoretical framework should be helpful in the better assessment of diversity and testing of the neutral theory by using abundance data.

Our aims were to find how, and at which spatial scale of the landscape, the biodiversity of a rural agricultural landscape of a central European country (Czech Republic) is affected by land use. We used a multi-taxa approach based on six taxa, namely (i) birds, (ii) bees and wasps, (iii) beetles, (iv) butterflies, (v) land snails, and (vi) plants, in 25 traditional fruit orchards. We carried out spatial partitioning of three different types of land use (orchards, deciduous woodlands and grasslands) with radii ranging from 200 m to 3200 m. With respect to land use, the spatial partitioning showed that land snails, and bees and wasps were influenced to the lowest area of surrounding land use types, followed by beetles, butterflies and plants, and finally birds. Species richness in most of the taxa studied was enhanced by an increase in the area covered by orchards in the surrounding landscape. Our findings support the idea that multi-taxa responses to land use in landscape studies should be measured at different scales, for example, by making use of spatial partitioning. Our study showed that although they are an artificial patches, traditional orchards help maintain biodiversity in rural agricultural landscapes, and that an increase in the area covered by similar patches in the surroundings also increases the species richness of the studied taxa.

The hypothesis addressed is that if fiscal crisis and economic recession lead to biodiversity misuse, then, even strong conservation strategies such as those allegedly implemented in developed countries may not be resilient to macro-economic shocks. Empirical data and official statistics are combined in an interpretive way. Mechanisms that enable criminal misuse of biotic resources in protected areas, forests and coastal areas of the country are defined and quantified through specific examples of illegal hunting, logging and fishing. They are defined as the Active Sampling effect, the Market De-concentration effect and the Underground Market effect of crisis. Such crime enablers are not, most likely, country-level singularities; they can be generalized both through their trans-boundary effects and in view of their interference with international conservation strategy and Law.

Given its scale of influence and infrastructure undertakings, it is set to bring far-reaching environmental impacts to regions such as Southeast Asia, one of the biologically richest and most diverse regions in the world. Knowing where and what biodiversity BRI will potentially affect is crucial to plan and address its negative impacts. Using BRI transport infrastructure spatial data, we conducted a GIS analysis of the potential BRI impacts in Southeast Asia on terrestrial and marine biodiversity indicators, including protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), terrestrial ecoregions, forest cover, threatened species, and fragile ecosystems such as seagrasses, mangroves, and coral reefs. We assessed the potential impacts across four key distance thresholds (1, 5, 25, and 50 km \""impact zones\"") on either side of the routes. For the terrestrial routes we assessed impacts for five different types of linear rail and road infrastructure development. Within 1 km of all routes 32 PAs, 40 KBAs and 29 ecoregions are intersected. While, 142 threatened species including 26 critically endangered species are within 5 km from new rail, which are also commonly found in frontier landscapes. In marine ecosystems 20 marine PAs and 16 KBAs are intersected by BRI marine routes. We conclude by discussing ways BRI could minimise its environmental impacts and utilise its political weight to advance conservation efforts in host nations."

We investigated the indicator value of each group by examining the degree of congruence of its species-richness pattern with that of the other groups and the efficiency of its complementary network in conserving the other groups and biodiversity. The two techniques differed in many respects in their outputs, but they both showed woody plants as the best biodiversity indicator. There was in general low congruence in the species richness patterns across the different groups. Significant relationships were found between woody plants and birds, Orthoptera and terrestrial herpetofauna, and birds and aquatic herpetofauna. None of the optimal complementary networks of the groups we examined protected all species of the other groups. Nevertheless, the complementary network of woody plants adequately conserved all groups except orchids. We conclude that the principle of complementarity must be integrated into the methodology of evaluating an indicator. In an applied context, our results provide a scientific background on which to base a biomonitoring program for the Dadia Reserve. In a wider scope, if the group of woody plants prove an adequate biodiversity indicator for other Mediterranean areas as well, this will be important because it will facilitate conservation-related decisions for the entire Mediterranean region.

The high diversity of dragonflies in heavily industrialized areas is therefore paradoxical, to say the least. We compared diversity of dragonflies in three main freshwater habitat types (natural and human-made) occurring in Upper Silesia (Central Europe). We used multivariate methods and diversity indices for a general analysis, comprising both species richness and the species composition of assemblages. We recorded 50 species in mine subsidence pools from the total of 54 sampled species. These included a high proportion of habitat specialists (typically threatened species). We emphasize that secondary habitats (e.g. spontaneously originated mine subsidence pools) should not a priori be regarded as ecological traps, because these often are the available habitats with highest quality. These habitats significantly outweigh ponds in species richness and proportion of habitat specialists. The conservation potential of specific secondary habitats lies in the fact that these habitats can substitute for very rare natural wetlands often restricted to higher elevations. We assume that high diversity in this type of secondary habitats is not random, but rather that it depends on environmental heterogeneity caused by a specific allogenic succession process occurring as a direct consequence of mining.

In addition to food production, multifunctionality of landscapes, including values and ecosystem services like biodiversity, recreation and culture, is now focus for management. This study explores how a scenario approach, involving different stakeholders, may help to improve landscape management for biodiversity conservation. Local farmers and executives at the County Administrative Board were invited to discuss rural development and conditions for farmland biodiversity in two Swedish landscapes. The potential biodiversity for three future land use scenarios for the two landscapes was discussed: nature conservation, outdoor recreation and energy production, and compared with current and historical landscapes in each region. Analyses of habitat areas, connectedness and landscape diversity suggested that the energy and recreation scenarios had a negative impact on farmland biodiversity, whereas the nature conservation scenario, the current and historically reconstructed landscapes had a higher potential for biodiversity. The farmers appreciated the nature conservation scenario, but also the energy production scenario and they highlighted the need of increased subsidies for management of biodiversity. The farmers in the high production area were less interested in nature quality per se. The executives had similar opinions as the farmers, but disagreed on the advantages with energy production, as this would be in conflict with the high biodiversity and recreational values. The local physical and socio-economical conditions differ between landscapes and potentially shaped the stakeholders emotional attachment to the local environment, their opinions and decisions on how to manage the land. We stress the importance of incorporating local knowledge, visions and regional prerequisites for different land uses in conservation, since site and landscape specific planning for biodiversity together with a flexible subsidy system are necessary to reach the conservation goals within EU.

Addressing biodiversity conservation in post-conflict Colombia	Environmental Science & Policy	02/01/2020	10.1016/j.envsci.2019.11.012	2	The post-conflict scenario in Colombia poses several environmental urgencies, making it necessary to identify and prioritize new challenges for biodiversity conservation and ecosystems management. It is critical to understand how government agencies, NGOs, and academics perceive these challenges, as they all contribute to fundamental decision-making on environmental issues. To achieve this objective we formulated fifty-two research questions that were edited, evaluated, and prioritized by members of each group in a dedicated workshop. Ten of these questions were identified as top priorities and shared with twenty additional members of each group. Perceptions and rankings of the ten priority questions were then compared among groups, but no statistical difference was found. These results highlight that broadly similar goals for biodiversity conservation are shared by all key decision makers in post-conflict Colombia. Namely, conservation through sustainable management practices and development of local economies previously affected by the conflict. The process of developing and prioritizing these research questions helped to identify key drivers of biodiversity loss and create a research agenda to mitigate environmental impacts in post-conflict Colombia.

Lack of consensus might be caused by different diversity metrics used and different spatial scales examined. In particular, the impacts of different biodiversity indices on the plant diversity-plant productivity relationship of alpine grasslands at different spatial scales of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) require investigation. We investigated the relations of multi-dimensional diversity indices (species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and Pielou evenness) with aboveground and belowground plant biomass in the alpine grasslands of the QTP by linear mixed model (LMM). We assessed the plant diversity and biomass of alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert steppe from 5 sites across the vast landscape of the QTP by using 6 randomly placed plots in each site and 27 replicated quadrats in each plot. The species richness of the studied alpine grasslands ranged from 2 to 35, aboveground plant dry biomass ranged from 17 to 838 gm(-2), and belowground plant dry biomass ranged from 398 to 3945 gm(-2). The species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices were positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass at the landscape scale, whereas the Pielou evenness index was negatively correlated with aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass at the landscape scale. Less than 20% sites showed significant relationships between plant diversity indices and plant biomass at site scale. Plant biomass partitioning between the root and shoot was not correlated with the species richness, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou evenness indices at all scales. The plant diversity-biomass relationships of the alpine grassland ecosystems in the QTP depend on both the type (or dimension) of the biodiversity index and the spatial scale of sampling. Thus, the design and implementation of plant diversity conservation should consider different dimensions of plant diversity. It is not enough to increase species richness only in the process of grassland restoration and conservation, but also to reduce species evenness so as to promote productivity more fully, for example, in planting artificial grassland.

Even so, we would still be hindered by a 'Darwinian shortfall', that is, the lack of relevant phylogenetic information for most organisms. Overall, there are too few comprehensive phylogenies, large uncertainties in the estimation of divergence times, and, most critically, unknown evolutionary models linking phylogenies to relevant ecological traits and life history variation. Here, we discuss these issues and offer suggestions for further research to support evolutionary-based conservation planning.

The Southern Ocean has the largest microbial biodiversity of the entire Antarctica. Isolated by the Antarctic Convergence, with temperatures hovering around 0 degrees C, the region poses great physiological challenges to marine life. As a result, it has developed a peculiar endemic biodiversity. In the past, Antarctic Ocean microbial communities were generally assumed to be species poor but recent results suggested that it may contain more substantial microbial diversity. In order to have a complete overview of the bacterial community structure of Ross Sea waters, total DNA was extracted from samples and the bacteria biodiversity was studied by Polymerase chain reaction and deraturing gradient electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting. The genetic target used was the hypervariable region V3 of the 16S rDNA. DGGE analysis was conducted on water samples obtained from different sites of the Ross Sea and sampled in different periods during the 2010-2011 Italia Antarctic expedition. To evaluate the structure of the bacterial community a cluster analysis was performed. Community structure and richness were estimated with various statistical indices. Almost all samples were quite heterogeneous with scarce correlation with sampling site and period. Most of samples showed rather high richness and communities had a well-defined structure with scarce presence of dominant species. Principal bands were excised from the gel, sequenced and compared with National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database. A dendrogram was built to understand the relationships between the sequences. The comparison in the database showed that 67% of the sequences were close to unclassified species or uncultured bacteria.

Empirical support for this relationship in forests is urgently needed, as these ecosystems play an important role in carbon sequestration. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested whether tree wood production is positively related to tree species richness while controlling for climatic factors, by analyzing 55265 forest inventory plots in 11 forest types across five European countries. On average, wood production was 24% higher in mixed than in monospecific forests. Taken alone, wood production was enhanced with increasing tree species richness in almost all forest types. In some forests, wood production was also greater with increasing numbers of tree types. Structural Equation Modeling indicated that the increase in wood production with tree species richness was largely mediated by a positive association between stand basal area and tree species richness. Mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation affected wood production and species richness directly. However, the direction and magnitude of the influence of climatic variables on wood production and species richness was not consistent, and vary dependent on forest type. Conclusions: Our analysis is the first to find a local scale positive relationship between tree species richness and tree wood production occurring across a continent. Our results strongly support incorporating the role of biodiversity in management and policy plans for forest carbon sequestration.

A consortium led by Plymouth University Marine Institute was funded by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to design and implement a study (initially funded for 3 years) to examine the effects of the closure on both nekton and epibenthos. This paper provides a detailed account of the methodology employed from survey design to data analysis to provide a protocol for future MPA monitoring programmes. Information on historical fishing effort, substrate distributions and current and previous closure boundaries was overlaid using GIS to locate suitable monitoring sites. Non-destructive and cost-effective techniques, including a towed high-definition video array and static baited video, were used to quantify changes in relative abundances of epibenthos and nekton over three years at sites previously fished but now closed to bottom towed fishing compared to both fished and un-fished reference sites. The monitoring programme as described provides a model for robust, cost-effective evaluation of the efficacy of policy instruments for feedback into the adaptive management cycle.

Responses from carabid beetle and spider assemblages in Western France	Urban Ecosystems	03/01/2014	10.1007/s11252-013-0307-2	9	During the last decades, urban consolidation has been developed to minimize spatial expansion of cities, yet very few studies investigated whether it would actually reduce some negative effects of urbanization on biodiversity. In this study, we compared the invertebrate assemblages associated with two distinct urban forms (compact vs. conventional), focusing on two arthropod taxa often used as bioindicators, and dominant in urban habitats: spiders and carabid beetles. The following parameters were estimated: assemblage composition, species richness, activity-density total, per species (excluding seldom-recorded species) and per size class. The field collection was performed in 2009 using pitfall traps randomly set in hedgerows within 6 sites (representing 251 traps). A total of 4,413 spiders belonging to 117 species and 2,077 adult carabid beetles belonging to 39 species were collected. We found few significant differences in carabid beetle and spider assemblages between the two urban forms. The species richness of both groups was independent from the neighborhood design. Only four species of carabid beetles and ten of spiders significantly reacted to the neighborhood design, and no difference was found among the two designs for all other species. Large carabid beetles were more abundant and small spiders less abundant in the new neighborhood design compared to the conventional one. For both carabid beetles and spiders, no difference in assemblage composition was found between neighborhood designs. We therefore conclude that urban consolidation, by permitting a higher human density with similar arthropod assemblages, could contribute to reduce biodiversity loss in cities.

To evaluate the biodiversity costs of increasing carbon sequestration, we quantified changes in ecosystemcarbon stocks and the associated changes in communities of plants and ants resulting from fire suppression in savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot. Fire suppression resulted in increased carbon stocks of 1.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) since 1986 but was associated with acute species loss. In sites fully encroached by forest, plant species richness declined by 27%, and ant richness declined by 35%. Richness of savanna specialists, the species most at risk of local extinction due to forest encroachment, declined by 67% for plants and 86% for ants. This loss highlights the important role of fire in maintaining biodiversity in tropical savannas, a role that is not reflected in current policies of fire suppression throughout the Brazilian Cerrado. In tropical grasslands and savannas throughout the tropics, carbon mitigation programs that promote forest cover cannot be assumed to provide net benefits for conservation.	Abreu, Rodolfo C.

While morphological diversity metrics are used increasingly in paleobiological studies, quantitative data on the spatial distribution of morphology in modern ecosystems are scarce. Comparison between different aspects of diversity is often essential in understanding the processes underlying observed biodiversity patterns. In this paper, the morphological traits of Suaeda salsa were characterized to explore the potentiality of morphological diversity and identify the unique diversity available at various water-salt soil assemblage ecosites. The newly created wetland of Huanghe River Delta is a nature laboratory for study of plant morphological diversity. Based on an extended general investigation, according to the variation of microphysiognomy of the newly formed Huanghe River Delta, we selected six plots as sample sites for the measurements of an individual's traits and selected environmental factors and collection of genetic variability test samples. We performed descriptive statistics, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and cluster analysis to recognize the overall variation of S. salsa as a whole, within the sites, and among populations. The results show that a high level of variability was observed among the individuals in the field. We use sites as a categorical, independent variable that formed six interval-dependent variables for every five plant traits to perform ANOVA analysis, and the results show that all traits have a significant difference (p < 0.001) among sites, but both all traits and sites do not have a significant difference. The height and base leaf width of S. salsa show a significant correlation with the soil water content, soil salt content, and the combined index of salt to water. However, they did not show that the plants traits have a reliable relationship with the soil property. The cluster analysis result indicated that S. salsa can be classified into at least three ecotypes. Comparison of the genetic variation surveyed by starch gel electrophoresis to allozyme polymorphism indicated that morphological diversity is a good metric for quantifying spatial patterns of biodiversity.

While the importance of coastal geomorphology in determining the patterns of biological communities is relatively well studied on the terrestrial side of the shoreline, the respective relationships have been rarely studied seaward from the shoreline. Therefore, we aimed to fill this research gap by relating coastal geomorphology to marine benthic biodiversity. We studied the variability of species richness of macroscopic seabed fauna and flora along different shore geomorphic types in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. The shore was classified into nine geomorphological types. Spatial buffers of sizes 125-1000 m (hereafter \""scales\"") were formed around each segment of shoreline and mean values of faunal, floral, and total species richness were calculated in each segment and scale. ANOVA revealed that biodiversity significantly differed between the shore types. Generally, the biodiversity was the highest among the types \""Scraps and steep slopes in sand\"", \""Exposed rocky cliffs with boulder talus base\"" and \""Sheltered rocky rubble shores\"" and the lowest among the type \""Exposed, solid man-made structures\"". Smaller spatial scales hosted higher biodiversity but the interaction between shore type and scale was not statistically significant. To conclude, the coastal geomorphology reflects the general patterns of underwater biodiversity, and thus, the information of shore geomorphic types can be used in coastal management and oil pollution combating prioritization in the case when the information of underwater biota is not available."

Their continued loss through deforestation and agriculture is the main threat to species globally, more than disease, invasive species, and climate change. However, not all tropical forests have the same ability to sustain biodiversity. Those that have been disturbed by humans, including forests previously cleared and regrown (secondary growth), have lower levels of species richness compared with undisturbed (primary) forests. The difference is even greater considering extinctions that will later emanate from the disturbance (extinction debt). Here, we find that Haiti has less than 1% of its original primary forest and is therefore among the most deforested countries. Primary forest has declined over three decades inside national parks, and 42 of the 50 highest and largest mountains have lost all primary forest. Our surveys of vertebrate diversity (especially amphibians and reptiles) on mountaintops indicates that endemic species have been lost along with the loss of forest. At the current rate, Haiti will lose essentially all of its primary forest during the next two decades and is already undergoing a mass extinction of its biodiversity because of deforestation. These findings point to the need, in general, for better reporting of forest cover data of relevance to biodiversity, instead of \""total forest\"" as defined by the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization. Expanded detection and monitoring of primary forest globally will improve the efficiency of conservation measures, inside and outside of protected areas."	Hedges, S.

7155	WOS:000169439100001	Biodiversity and functioning of ecological communities - why is diversity important in some cases and unimportant in others?	Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science	06/01/2001	NA	20	The paper gives an overview of ecological theories and hypotheses that have been raised in order to predict diversity-function relationships. In particular, those reasons are discussed that may explain the discrepancy between the theoretical expectation for widespread effects of diversity on functioning and the ambiguous empirical evidence for such effects. Structural differences in the ecology of plants, invertebrates, and micro-organisms are considered which lead to differences in diversity-function relationships among these groups of organisms. Four criteria are derived that determine diversity-function relationships: (1) motility of the organisms under consideration, (2) decoupling of population persistence and functional activity in these organisms, (3) species richness of the organisms' community, and (4) equilibrium stability of the considered ecological process. From these criteria the authors predict that measurable effects of diversity on functioning are (a) likely to be found in plants and in micro-organisms while they are (b) unlikely to be found in the soil fauna. They predict that diversity is (c) likely to affect primary production, soil energy turnover, and nutrient losses from the system, while it is (d) unlikely to durably influence litter decomposition rate. It is shown that these predictions are largely corroborated by empirical evidence compiled from the literature. The issue of spatial and temporal scale is briefly discussed.

We argue that a 'symbolic transformation' of environmental governance in Bulgaria and Croatia has occurred, as the interplay between Europeanization and domestic politics has led to differential empowerment of state and non-state actors resulting in ineffective environmental governance. While proenvironment non-state groups (environmental non-governmental organizations, scientists) and European Union institutions were empowered in the phase of formal compliance, economic interest groups have held sway over the phase of practical (non-) compliance. At the same time, state actors have responded rationally to retain their power by adapting to opposing forces from above and below. We conclude by discussing the 'symbolic transformation' of environmental governance shifting between 'command-and-control' and 'non-hierarchical' coordination with regards to the transformative power of Europe in light of Europeanization research in old and new European Union member states.

We analyze responses of species attributes to diversity level and resource availability, and explore their consequences for ecosystem functioning and ultimately assess the contributions of five traits (vegetative plant height, clonal growth, root depth, cespitose habit and seed mass) to ecosystem functioning defined by spatial stability of community biomass. We found that functional traits disproportionately affected spatial stability. Relationships between species functional traits and spatial stability of community biomass indicated that diversity of vegetative plant height facilitated stability of a nitrogen fertilized undisturbed natural community (NAT), and that of a phosphorus fertilized forb, legume and bunchgrass community (FLB). The clonal growth form was also identified as a stabilizing trigger for a unfertilized undisturbed natural community (NAT), whereas diversity in root depth, cespitose habit and seed mass were related to destabilization of a nitrogen fertilized rhizomatous grass community (RRR). Studies quantifying interactions among plant traits, community structure and ecological functioning will contribute much more to understanding of the effects of the ecological behavior of specific traits on the ecosystem functioning.

This study aims to set the foundations of a spatial conservation strategy by identifying the most important catchments for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in Europe. Using data on 1296 species of fish, mollusc, odonate and aquatic plant, and the key biodiversity area criteria (species Red List status, range restriction and uniqueness of species assemblages), we identified a network of Critical Catchments for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. Applying spatial prioritisation, we show how the prioritised network differs from the ideal case of protecting all Critical Catchments and how it changes when protected areas are included, and we also identify gaps between the prioritised network and existing protected areas. Critical Catchments (n=8423) covered 45% of the area of Europe, with 766 qualifying (trigger') species located primarily in southern Europe. The prioritised network, limited to 17% of the area of Europe, comprised 3492 catchments mostly in southern and eastern Europe and species targets were met for at least 96% of the trigger species. We found the majority of Critical Catchments to be inadequately covered by protected areas. However, our prioritised network presents a possible solution to augment protected areas to meet policy targets while also achieving good species coverage. Policy implications. While Critical Catchments cover almost half of Europe, priority catchments are mostly in southern and eastern Europe where the current level of protection is not sufficient. This study presents a foundation for a Europe-wide systematic conservation plan to ensure the persistence of freshwater biodiversity. Our study provides a powerful new tool for optimising investment on the conservation of freshwater biodiversity and for meeting targets set forth in international biodiversity policies, conventions and strategies.

Mitigation to facilitate animal movement through such landscapes requires similar attention to spatial scale, particularly when they involve complex topography, diverse types of human land use, and transportation infrastructure. We modeled connectivity for Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) in the Shencottah Gap, a multiple-use region separating two tiger reserves in the Western Ghats, India. Using 840 km of surveys for animal signs within a region of 621 km(2), we modeled landscape linkages via resource selection functions integrated across two spatial resolutions, and then potential dispersal corridors within these linkages using circuit theoretical models. Within these corridors, we further identified potential small-scale movement paths across a busy transportation route via least-cost paths and evaluated their viability. Both elephants and gaur avoided human-dominated habitat, resulting in broken connectivity across the Shencottah Gap. Predicted corridor locations were sensitive to analysis resolution, and corridors derived from scale-integrated habitat models correlated best with habitat quality. Less than 1% of elephant and gaur detections occurred in habitat that was poorer in quality than the lowest quality component of the movement path across the transportation route, suggesting that connectivity will require habitat improvement. Only 28% of dispersal corridor area and 5% of movement path length overlapped with the upper 50% quantile of the landscape linkage; thus, jointly modeling these three components enabled a more nuanced evaluation of connectivity than any of them in isolation.

8607	WOS:000270193300004	Forest Management and Biodiversity Conservation Based on Natural Ecosystem Dynamics in Northern Europe: The Complexity Challenge	Ambio	09/01/2009	NA	203	Recent research in northern Europe has revised many long-held conceptions of the complexity of forest ecosystems and their natural structure and dynamics. The unveiling of the picture of natural characteristics of forest ecosystem structure and dynamics reveals much more diversity than its traditional complement, highlighting the importance of non-stand-replacing disturbances and the associated heterogeneous and dynamic stand and landscape structures. This increasing detail is a reflection of a fundamental change in the ecological understanding of forests as complex ecosystems. In particular, the generalization that the boreal forest is regulated by fierce stand-replacing disturbances, leading to the dominance of even-aged stand successions, has been disproved. However, this misconception has, until now, been repeated and used to legitimize the dominant practice of clear-cutting as a nature-based way to manage the forest. The practical conclusion of this review paper is that the dominating forest management model in North European boreal forests, which is based on the clear-cut harvesting of timber and growing of even-aged stands, is in contradiction with the variable and complex characteristics of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in naturally dynamic forests with negligible human impact. As a consequence, the structural variation of the boreal forest under management has been grossly truncated compared with its natural range. Because of this, and due to the scarcity of protection areas in many regions of northern Europe, it is not likely that the conservation of native biodiversity and ecological sustainability will be attained, assuming that the model of forest management remains unchanged. Thus, there is a strong incentive for change in the prevailing forest management model toward one that is based on natural ecosystem dynamics and an understanding of forests as complex systems.

The biodiversity footprints were quantified using mean species abundance statistics, whereas the ecological footprint refers to the impacts on bioproductivity. We used a data set of 1340 product systems subdivided into 13 product groups, which included various types of energy generation and material production. We found that the importance of direct land use vs. carbon dioxide emissions is different for biodiversity footprints compared to ecological footprints. This difference is particularly relevant if the environmental impact of bio-based products (dominated by direct land use) is compared with the environmental impact of fossil-based products (dominated by CO2 emissions). Our results also show that the relative importance of different drivers can change over time within the biodiversity footprint and that the relative importance of climate change significantly increased for longer time horizons. As the interpretation of the biodiversity footprint can differ from the ecological footprint, the inclusion of impacts on biodiversity should be considered in the footprint calculation of products.

This involved examining changes in chemicals, temperature, flow, and macroinvertebrate diversity from the 1970s until 2017 for a wastewater-dominated river downstream of Swindon in the United Kingdom (population ~ 220 000). When the wastewater treatment process changed from trickling filter to activated sludge in 1991, biological oxygen demand was nearly halved (90th percentile from 8.1 to 4.6 mg/L), ammonia peaks dropped more than 7-fold (90th percentile from 3.9 to 0.53 mg/L), whereas dissolved oxygen climbed consistently above 60% saturation (10th percentile from 49 to 64%) at a sampling point 2 km downstream of the wastewater treatment plant. A sustained increase in the number of macroinvertebrate species was evident from that point. River flow did not change, temperature rose slightly, and the major metal concentrations declined steadily over most of the monitoring period. Neither the introduction of phosphate stripping in 1999 nor the use of tertiary granular activated charcoal from 2008 to 2014 had strong positive effects on subsequent macroinvertebrate diversity. That the diversity still had not reached the ideal status by 2016 may be related to the modest habitat quality, agricultural pesticides, and limited recolonization potential in the catchment. The results indicate that urban wastewaters, with their chemical pollutants, are today probably not the biggest threat to the macroinvertebrate diversity of multiply stressed lowland rivers in the United Kingdom.

Organisms leave DNA traces in the environment, e.g., in soil, water, and air. These DNA traces are referred to as environmental DNA (eDNA). The analysis of eDNA is a highly sensitive method with the potential to rapidly assess local diversity and the status of threatened species. We searched for DNA traces of 30 target amphibian species of conservation concern, at different levels of threat, using an environmental DNA metabarcoding approach, together with an extensive sequence reference database to analyse water samples from six montane sites in the Atlantic Coastal Forest and adjacent Cerrado grasslands of Brazil. We successfully detected DNA traces of four declined species (Hylodes ornatus,Hylodes regius,Crossodactylus timbuhy, andVitreorana eurygnatha); two locally disappeared (Phasmahyla exilisandPhasmahyla guttata); and one species that has not been seen since 1968 (putatively assigned toMegaelosia bocainensis). We confirm the presence of species undetected by traditional methods, underscoring the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding for biodiversity monitoring at low population densities, especially in megadiverse tropical sites. Our results support the potential application of eDNA in conservation biology, to evaluate persistence and distribution of threatened species in surveyed habitats or sites, and improve accuracy of red lists, especially for species undetected over long periods.

Species distributional modelling is a popular approach to quantifying biodiversity whereby occurrence data are related to environmental covariates. An important confounding factor that is often overlooked in the development of such models is uncertainty due to imperfect detection. Here, I demonstrate how an analytical approach that accounts for the bias due to imperfect detection can be applied retrospectively to an existing biodiversity survey data set to produce more realistic estimates of species distributions and unbiased covariate relationships. Location Pilbara biogeographic region, Australia. Methods As a component of the Pilbara survey, presence/absence (i.e. undetected) data on small ground-dwelling mammals were collected. I applied a multiseason occupancy modelling approach to six of the most common species encountered during this survey. Detection and occupancy rates, as well as extinction and colonization probabilities, were determined, and the influence of covariates on these parameters was examined using the multi-model inference approach. Results Detection probabilities for all six species were considerably lower than 1.0 and varied across time and species. Naive estimates of occupancy underestimated occupancy rates corrected for species detectability by up to 45%. Seasonal variation in occupancy status was attributed to changes in detection for two of the focal species, while reproductive events explained variation in occupancy in three others. Covariates describing the substrate strongly influenced site occupancy for most of the species modelled. A comparison of the occupancy model with a generalized linear model, assuming perfect detection, showed that the effects of the covariates were underestimated in the latter model. Main conclusions The application of the multiseason occupancy modelling approach to the Pilbara mammal data set demonstrated a powerful framework for examining changes in site occupancy, as well as local colonization and extinction rates of species which are not confounded by variable species detection rates.

An assessment using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) as bioindicators in a tropical dry forest natural park	Ecological Indicators	10/01/2020	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106580	5	Ecotourism can be defined as an environmental activity that takes place in well-preserved areas for recreation and with the responsibility of promoting their conservation. Nowadays, ecotourism is seen as a friendly pastime, but it can potentially affect negatively community diversity and structure by a number of processes such as soil compaction, erosion, and habitat alteration, among many others. Nonetheless, there is hardly any information on the impact of ecotourism in the Tropical Dry Forests and protected areas of the Neotropical region. In an attempt to fill this knowledge gap, the effect of ecotourism was evaluated in a study of a Tropical Dry Forest in the Tayrona National Natural Park of Colombia using dung beetles as bioindicators. A large-scale sampling of three sites with different levels of tourism intensity (no tourism - NT, low tourism - LT, and high tourism - HT) was performed using pitfall tramps baited with human/pig dung during two climatic seasons (rainy and dry). A total of 3238 individuals belonging to nine genera and 15 species were collected. Significant differences in abun-dances, richness, and the Shannon Wiener diversity index were observed between areas with tourism and those without. These differences disappeared during the dry season in response to the strong reduction in species abundance and richness associated to that time of year. All areas maintained a homogeneous beetle structure in terms of functional groups present irrelevant of the intensity level of tourism. Beta diversity analysis shows that the dung beetle assemblage has a nested structure, indicating that the pressure exerted by tourism entails the loss of particular species. Our results advocate that it is necessary to implement conservation strategies in order to reduce the negative impact of tourism on the National Park's biodiversity.

Predictions regarding how these changes will affect the biodiversity and interspecific relationships of small mammals are necessary to pro-actively inform conservation planning. We used a set of online occurrence records and machine learning methods to create bioclimatic envelope models for 17 species of small mammals (rodents and shrews) across Alaska. Models formed the basis for sets of species-specific distribution maps for 2010 and were projected forward using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A2 scenario to predict distributions of the same species for 2100. We found that distributions of cold-climate, northern, and interior small mammal species experienced large decreases in area while shifting northward, upward in elevation, and inland across the state. In contrast, many southern and continental species expanded throughout Alaska, and also moved down-slope and toward the coast. Statewide community assemblages remained constant for 15 of the 17 species, but distributional shifts resulted in novel species assemblages in several regions. Overall biodiversity patterns were similar for both time frames, but followed general species distribution movement trends. Biodiversity losses occurred in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Seward Peninsula while the Beaufort Coastal Plain and western Brooks Range experienced modest gains in species richness as distributions shifted to form novel assemblages. Quantitative species distribution and biodiversity change projections should help land managers to develop adaptive strategies for conserving dispersal corridors, small mammal biodiversity, and ecosystem functionality into the future.

However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and similar to 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which similar to 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.

493	WOS:000329431400008	Is there a link between deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem function?	Marine Ecology-an Evolutionary Perspective	01/09/2013	10.1111/maec.12019	12	Studying the diversity-ecosystem function relationship in the deep sea is of primary importance in the face of biodiversity loss and for our understanding of how the deep sea functions. Results from the first study of diversity-ecosystem function relationships in the deep sea (Danovaro etal. 2008; Current Biology, 18, 1-8) are unexpected and show an exponential relationship between deep-sea nematode diversity and ecosystem function and efficiency, although this relationship appears largely restricted to relatively low diversities [ES(51) <25]. Here, we investigate the relationship between nematode diversity and several independent measures/proxies of ecosystem function (sediment community oxygen consumption, bacterial biomass, bacterial extracellular enzyme activity) and efficiency (ratio of bacterial/nematode carbon to organic C content of the sediment) on the New Zealand continental slope. Nematode diversity at our study sites was relatively high [ES(51)=30-42], and there was no relationship between species/functional diversity and ecosystem function/efficiency after accounting for the effects of water depth and food availability. Our results are consistent with a breakdown of the exponential diversity-function relationship at high levels of diversity, which may be due to increased competition or greater functional redundancy. Future studies need to take into account as many environmental factors and as wide a range of diversities as possible to provide further insights into the diversity-ecosystem function relationship in the largest ecosystem on Earth.

A recent faunal inventory (BIOLAVE) was conducted on the underwater lava flows of Piton de La Fournaise and constitutes the first submarine survey on the south-east side of the island. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the species richness in the different echinoderm classes and assess their potential as indicator of the colonisation of lava with different ages. During 8 days, 9 sites with different habitats defined by depth and substrate homogeneity were explored using a stratified sampling. Description of echinoderms and comparison of the taxonomic composition between sites of different ages and depths were presented. 45 species of the 5 classes were identified, belonging to 23 families and 32 genera. Ophiuroid was the most diverse class (22 species), followed by echinoids (13 species), asteroids and holothuroids (6 species each), and crinoids (2 species). Species number increased with lava flow's age, except for echinoids, which showed a higher species number on recent sites, but ophiuroids only showed a significantly higher species number on the oldest sites. On the contrary, species number tended to decrease with depth, but echinoids only showed a significantly higher species number on shallow water. Some asteroid, echinoid and holothuroid species, such as Aquilonastra richmondi, Asthenosoma variurn, Echinothrix spp., Echinometra mathaei and Euapta godeffroyi, were observed on the most recent sites only, while some ophiuroid species were observed in deeper sites only. These characteristic species could be seen as bioindicators of disturbed environment or have a distribution restricted to deeper areas.

There is a need to project possible future land use and assess impacts on nature reserves as a guide to future management. We assessed the potential biodiversity impacts of alternative future land use scenarios in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. An existing regression-based simulation model was used to project three alternative scenarios of future rural home development. The spatial patterns of forecasted development were then compared to several biodiversity response variables that included cover types, species habitats, and biodiversity indices. We identified the four biodiversity responses most at risk of exurban development, designed growth management policies to protect these areas, and tested their effectiveness in two alternative future scenarios. We found that the measured biodiversity responses, including riparian habitat, elk winter range, migration corridors, and eight other land cover, habitat, and biodiversity indices, are likely to undergo substantial conversion (between 5% and 40%) to exurban development by 2020. Future habitat conversion to exurban development outside the region's nature reserves is likely to impact wildlife populations within the reserves. Existing growth management policies will provide minimal protection to biodiversity in this region. We identified specific growth management policies, including incentives to cluster future growth near towns, that can protect ""at risk'' habitat types without limiting overall growth in housing."

Key questions remain, however, as to what extent plankton taxa within these lifeforms share responses to environmental change. Addressing this knowledge gap can provide additional information on the influence of environmental drivers, including climate change, on plankton communities. Here, we use a multi-decadal plankton time series to examine the extent to which taxa within lifeforms share responses to sea surface temperature (SST) change. At the North Sea scale, the individual taxa responses within the dinoflagellate lifeform are skewed towards a negative response to increasing SST, consolidating previous findings that dinoflagellate abundance is decreasing with ocean warming. The individual taxa responses within the zooplankton lifeforms, however, varied, suggesting that lifeform traits are less of a factor determining response to SST for zooplankton than for phytoplankton. The lifeform level of grouping taxa, therefore, is useful for communicating change in the state and functioning of ecosystems, but finer taxonomically resolved data are essential for determining the drivers of plankton community change, including climate influences, during formal assessments."

Weitzman's framework has been criticized as being unsuitable for the global problem of biodiversity loss. This paper responds to this critique. It is shown that Weitzman's framework of diversity measurement can be made practical and applicable by shifting the level analysis from species to ecosystems.

Measures to mitigate road mortality are costly so should be implemented using cost-effective measures in locations where the road mortality is consistently highest and non-random in different species. It is thus important to identify what features causes these biodiversity collision blackspots. Almost all of the data and literature on collisions refer to vertebrates with little known about invertebrates. We used data on butterfly roadkills in three large landscape plots in Poland to identify sites where the collision rate seems to be routinely high. Biodiversity collision blackspots were identified from occurrence in successive years using spatial hierarchical clustering. Biodiversity collision blackspots comprised just 4% of the total road length, but included 49% of all road-killed butterflies. Habitats within 500 m of each blackspot was compared to random non-blackspot sites using generalized linear mixed models. The occurrence of blackspots was linked with high traffic volume, but only when cover of grassland in a landscape was high and verges had low plant species richness. Similarly, blackspots occurred with high probability when traffic volume was high but especially if grassland cover in the landscape and verge mowing frequency were also high. These blackspots had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies in the surrounding landscape than in random sites. Biodiversity collision blackspots analysis identified road sections of high road mortality for different butterfly species. Moreover, blackspots were also indication of species rich areas of conservation concern that were intersected by roads. Thus, conservation practitioners may direct mitigation measures, such as less frequent mowing and speed limit, in a cost-efficient manner in these spatially-limited locations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The biodiversity of the three main feeding groups - predators, soil ingesters and litter consumers - was also significantly higher in the grass strips than in the field edges without strips, indicating that establishment of grassy margins in arable fields may enhance ecosystem services such as soil fertility and pest control. The grass strip habitat contained a large number of species of soil macrofauna, being second only to hedgerow habitat, with 10% of the total species list for the farm found only within the margins. Of the rare species recorded on the farm, five of the nine were from the grass strips, four of which were found only there. This study shows that establishing grassy strips in the margins of arable fields increases the biodiversity of the soil macrofauna, both within fields (alpha diversity) and across the farm (beta diversity).

We present a methodological approach for identification and mapping of important structural and environmental features of forest stands. Based on an analysis of habitats of red-listed species and a synthesis of results from research on spatial distribution of forest species, we developed a habitat inventory approach (Complementary Hotspot Inventory, CHI) that is currently used in forestry planning in Norway The CHI maps fine-scale hotspots for 12 habitat types that are further classified according to positions along main environmental gradients (productivity and humidity). Consisting of different substrates in different environments, these habitats to a large degree support different species assemblages. By incorporating both the hotspot and the complementary approach, the CHI produces data tuned for later conservation measures. The high spatial resolution of data facilitates the use of conservation measures at different spatial scales, from single-tree retention to forest reserves. A validation test of habitats identified by CHI showed that the density of red-listed species was four times that of randomly selected old forests. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During a survey of 18 wet Erica tetralix heathlands, we identified 624 species from 20 different taxonomic groups. Sites with the single indicator species M. alcon were significantly richer in typical wet heathland species and in Red List species but did not show significant differences in biotope quality (i.e., the number of different typical wet heathland biotope attributes) than sites without. In addition, we used a multispecies indicator approach including a group of nine species from five different taxonomic groups (two birds, two dragonflies, two butterflies, two vascular plants and one grasshopper). High quality sites (5-9 species from the multispecies indicator group present) tended to have more Red list species than low quality sites (0-4 species from the multispecies indicator group present) but did not expose differences in overall species richness, typical wet heathland species or in biotope quality. The number of species in this umbrella group, however, was positively correlated with both the diversity of typical wet heathland species and with biotope quality. Furthermore, the complementary information, of the species in the multispecies indicator group usefully signalled distinctions in biotope area and configuration, vulnerability to fragmentation, eutrophication, desiccation and contained species of different trophic levels; this was not the case for M. alcon as a single indicator species. We discuss the use of a single indicator and of a multispecies group as conservation umbrella and advocate a much wider use of combined knowledge from different taxonomic groups in conservation planning and evaluation.

We found that the risk of additional species extinction, following the loss of one species in model food webs, decreases with the number of species per functional group. For a given number of species per functional group, the risk of further extinctions is highest when an autotroph is removed and lowest when a top predator is removed. In addition, stability decreases when the distribution of interaction strengths in the webs is changed from equal to skew (few strong and many weak links). We also found that omnivory appears to stabilize model food webs. Our results indicate that high biodiversity may serve as an insurance against radical ecosystem changes.

Here, we show a pronounced latitudinal increase in phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic biodiversity in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades. We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.

From Assessing to Conserving Biodiversity: Conceptual and Practical Challenges	01/01/2019	10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2_18	2	This paper argues that biodiversity should be understood as a normative concept constrained by a set of adequacy conditions that reflect scientific explications of diversity. That there is a normative aspect to biodiversity has long been recognized by environmental philosophers though there is no consensus on the question of what, precisely, biodiversity is supposed to be. There is also disagreement amongst these philosophers as well as amongst conservationists about whether the operative norms should view biodiversity as a global heritage or as embodying local values. After critically analyzing and rejecting the first alternative, this paper gives precedence to local values in defining biodiversity but then notes many problems associated with this move. The adequacy conditions to constrain all natural features from being dubbed as biodiversity include a restriction to biotic elements, attention to variability, and to taxonomic spread, as well as measurability. The biotic elements could be taxa, community types, or even non-standard land cover units such as sacred groves. This approach to biodiversity is intended to explicate its use within the conservation sciences which is the context in which the concept (and term) was first introduced in the late 1980s. It differs from approaches that also attempt to capture the co-option of the term in other fields such as systematics.

Known primarily from environmental DNA sequences, the group contains few formally described and successfully cultured genera, all known as obligate endoparasites. Numerous studies have detected Cryptomycota as DNA sequences in aquatic, terrestrial, and animal associated habitats, though no study to date has specifically targeted the group by PCR. In this study, we developed Cryptomycota-specific and preferential primers for the 185 rRNA gene in order to facilitate studies on the biodiversity and ecology of the group. The diversity of sequences and habitat association of Cryptomycota was surveyed across three environments: freshwater sediment, marine sediment, and soil. The new primers were able to recover a large proportion of Cryptomycota sequences: of 56 sequences cloned or directly sequenced, 44 were unique OTUs and (39/44) 88.6 % were phylogenetically affiliated with Cryptomycota. This study expands the boundary of current Cryptomycota sequence diversity; unique Cryptomycota OTUs were spread across six of 12 supported Cryptomycota sub dades. Freshwater sediments and soil were consistently amplified with the Cryptomycota-preferential primers. Our results suggest that Cryptomycota are ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse components of essentially all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whose ecological functions should be better explored.

Urbanization can follow two extreme types of development within a continuum: land sharing (buildings mixed with dispersed green space) or land sparing (buildings interspersed with green patches that concentrate biodiversity-supporting vegetation). Recent local-scale studies indicate that biodiversity is typically favored by land sparing. We investigated which of these two types of urbanization is associated with a higher taxonomic (i.e. species richness), functional, and phylogenetic diversity of birds. To do so, we collected information on breeding and wintering bird assemblages in 45 land-sharing and 45 land-sparing areas in nine European cities, which provide the first attempt to explore this question using a large geographical scale and temporal replication. We found that land-sharing urban areas were significantly associated with a higher taxonomic and functional diversity of birds during winter, but not during the breeding season (with only a marginally significant effect for functional diversity). We found no association between the type of urban development and phylogenetic diversity. Our findings indicate that not all components of avian diversity are similarly affected by these two means of urban planning and highlight the importance of integrating the temporal perspective into this kind of studies. Our results also offer useful information to the current debate about the trade-off between biodiversity conservation and human well-being in the context of land sharing and sparing urban practices. In addition, we found that certain small-scale urban landscape characteristics (i.e. few impervious surfaces, high water or tree cover) and human practices (i.e. bird feeders or plants with berries) can help maintaining more diverse urban bird assemblages. We provide specific suggestions for both policymakers and citizens that hopefully will help to create more biodiversity-friendly cities in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using a choice experiment, WTP was estimated for the protection of the following attributes: animals (mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds), pollinating insects, plants (cacti and woody shrubs), soil quality and pristine landscapes. Visitors placed economic value on all of the attributes. The marginal mean WTP/visitor for the single levels of variation in the attributes ranged from US$4 (for supporting research on foxes) to US$26 (for maintaining soil quality) per visitor per month. These results can contribute to deciding which attributes are likely to be successful at raising funds for conservation. Our approach may be relevant to protected areas of the world with high conservation values, little funding and a lack of large, charismatic species.

The montane forests of this region are considered one of Conservation International's priority megadiversity hot spots. Over the last few decades, poverty, population pressure, environmental degradation, and political conflict have intensified in Chiapas. Widespread political unrest and violence continue despite a ""cease-fire"" between the Mexican government and supporters of the Zapatista movement that first appeared in 1994.

We analysed delta S between pre-1980 and post-1980 periods using 5 grid resolutions (10x10, 20x20, 40x40, 80x80 and 160x160 km). We also tested the effect of data quality and of unequal survey periods on delta S estimates, and checked for spatial autocorrelation of delta S estimates. Using data from equal survey periods, we found significant increases in hoverfly species richness in the Netherlands at fine scales, but no significant change at coarser scales indicating a decrease in beta diversity. In the UK, delta S was negative at fine scale, near zero at intermediate scales, and positive at coarse scales, indicating that the degree of spatial beta diversity increased between the time periods. The use of unequal survey periods (using longer periods in the past to compensate for lower survey intensity) tended to inflate past species richness, biasing delta S estimates downwards. High data quality thresholds sometimes obscured dynamics by reducing sample size, but never reversed trends. There was little spatial autocorrelation of delta S, implying that local drivers (land use change or environmental noise) are important in dynamics of hoverfly diversity. A second, sample agglomeration approach to measure scaling resulted in greater noise in delta S, obscuring the NL pattern, while still showing strong evidence of fine-scale richness loss in the UK. Our results indicate that explicit considerations of spatial (and temporal) scale are essential in studies documenting past biodiversity change, or projecting change into the future.

Researchers have tried to understand this relationship by focusing either on how diversity is influenced by the availability of resources, or alternatively, how resource abundance is influenced by species diversity. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox '... is species diversity the cause or the consequence of resources that limit community biomass?' Here we present results of an experiment that show it is possible for species diversity and resource density to exhibit reciprocal causal relationships in the same ecological system. Using a guild of ladybeetle predators and their aphid prey, we manipulated the number of predator species in field enclosures to examine how predator diversity impacts prey population size. At the same time, we manipulated the abundance of aphid prey in discrete habitat patches within each enclosure to determine how smaller-scale spatial variation in resource abundance affects the number of co-occurring predator species. We found that the number of ladybeetle species added to enclosures had a significant impact on aphid population dynamics because interference competition among the predators reduced per capita rates of predation and, in turn, the overall efficiency of the predator guild. At the same time, spatial variation in aphid abundance among smaller habitat patches generated variation in the observed richness of ladybeetles because more species occurred in patches where predators aggregated in response to high aphid density. The results of our experiment demonstrate that it is possible for species diversity to simultaneously be a cause and a consequence of resource density in the same ecological system, and they shed light on how this might occur for groups of mobile consumers that exhibit rapid responses to spatial and temporal variation in their prey.

Here we examine a one-trophic level system with generalized species interactions, including species-specific intraspecific and interspecific interaction strengths, and density-independent immigration from a regional species pool. Comparisons between results from numerical integrations and an approximate analytic calculation for random communities demonstrate good agreement, and both approaches yield abundance distributions of nearly arbitrary shape, including bimodality for intermediate immigration rates.

Management ranges from traditional shaded coffee garden to \""modern\"" unshaded monoculture. Recognizing the importance of both livelihoods and biodiversity, we examined how the plant diversity of coffee gardens was affected by a certain form of \""modernization,\"" which, from 1974 to 1988, was strongly promoted through the intervention of the Mexican State and international development agencies: that is, planting high-yield varieties (HYV) with little or no shade and using chemical fertilizers and herbicides. Our research also sought to use ecological statistical approaches to understand modifications in a traditional human ecosystem. It centered on two questions: ( 1) How do differences in coffee production, along a gradient of modernization, affect plant species richness? ( 2) What is the relative importance of ecological vs. socioeconomic factors in explaining plant diversity in individual coffee gardens? To answer these questions, we compared floristic diversity of four coffee-growing villages differing in ecological context and in the degree to which they were modernized. The two poles of our traditional/modern gradient are the villages of Tierra Colorada, where the traditional Mexican variety of coffee bushes, called cafe criollo (\""creole coffee\"") is not grown anymore, and San Lorenzo, where all the farms that we studied only grew criollo coffee. Discriminant analysis suggests that modernization can be viewed as a syndrome of traits, among which farmer's education and household size are important components. Overall, the small coffee gardens studied harbor high plant species richness. Our results show a significant negative effect of modernization on plant species richness in San Miguel, one of the four villages studied. Although ecological characteristics were prevalent in explaining species richness, the redundancy analyses (RDA) emphasized the complementary importance of socioeconomic factors in explaining variation in plant species richness in coffee gardens within a given community. Apparently, this importance increases as modernization sets in. In order words, when coffee gardens are managed in a traditional way, as in San Lorenzo, ecological factors are sufficient to explain most variation in species richness. However, in villages where cultivation includes modern practices, these practices exert a direct impact on species richness. The key loading factors for the socioeconomic RDAs were coffee variety, fertilizer, and age of coffee bushes. Our successful methodological approach suggests that numerical ecology offers promising tools for the analysis of human impacted decosystems."

Bioherms are reefs of glass sponges living on layers of dead sponges. In the same area as the sponge gardens, newly discovered bioherms in Howe Sound, BC (49.34.67 N, 123.16.26 W) at depths of 28- to 35-m are constructed exclusively by Aphrocallistes vastus, the cloud sponge. The sponge gardens had much higher taxon richness than the bioherms. The sponge garden had 106 species from 10 phyla, whereas the bioherm had only 15 species from 5 phyla. For recruiting juvenile rockfish (quillback, Sebastes maliger), the food subsidy of sponge gardens appears to be missing on bioherms of cloud sponge, where biodiversity is relatively low. While adult and subadult rockfishes (S. maliger, S. ruberrimus, S. proriger, and S. elongatus) were present on bioherms, no evidence for nursery recruitment of inshore rockfishes to bioherms was observed, whereas the sponge gardens supported high densities of newly recruited S. maliger, perhaps owing to the combination of both refuge and feeding opportunities. These results indicate that sponge gardens form a habitat for early stages of inshore S. maliger, whereas A. vastus bioherms are associated only with older juvenile and adult rockfishes.

Conserving the biodiversity of the Coral Triangle requires understanding the mechanisms by which this hotspot has evolved. Although there are several theories to explain the origins of this biodiversity hotspot, the center of origin theory has been criticized for lacking credible speciation mechanisms within the center of the Coral Triangle. In this paper, we examine the phylogeography and evolutionary history of coral reef-associated stomatopods. Results indicate significant regional population genetic structure in all 14 species examined. Several species exhibit patterns of Indian-Pacific Ocean differentiation, suggesting vicariance during Pleistocene low sea level stands may promote lineage diversification. However, all species show a pronounced pattern of differentiation between populations east and west of the Maluku Sea, although the precise location of this phylogeographic boundary varies among species. This pattern is most likely explained by limited water flow by the Halmahera Eddy, and thus larval transport and gene flow, across the Maluku Sea, promoting lineage diversification in this region and supporting the notion of a center of origin. In contrast, Bayesian analysis of regional patterns of differentiation suggested that the most basal populations of Haptosquilla pulchella and H. glyptocercus were found in reefs in the peripheral parts of their Pacific Ocean ranges, potentially suggesting support for the center of accumulation model. However, topology constraint tests indicated that the best trees were not significantly better than alternate topologies, limiting the inferences that can be drawn from this data. Although many processes are likely contributing to the Coral Triangle biodiversity hotspot, data from stomatopods clearly shows evidence for filters to dispersal and gene flow within the center, a result consistent with a center of origin. The identification of these barriers in stomatopods and many other unrelated marine fish and invertebrates is helping define regional limits of connectivity within the Coral Triangle, supporting regional conservation planning in this threatened ecosystem.

Paraguay is a landlocked, tropical country, which still holds enormous forested areas despite intense degradation. The country shows enormous potential algal biodiversity. We searched published records of algal species within Paraguay, checked their taxonomic status, and provided their locations, resulting in a thorough list of the algae known to date in Paraguay. Only 33 articles were published between 1897 and 2020. From the early 20(th)century and until the late 1970s, there were few publications on algae, and most studies were conducted within the last 7 years. We compiled records of 893 species from 54 orders and 10 phyla. Only freshwater algal records were found; none were terrestrial or from brackish lagoons. Most species belong to Charophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. The Lower Paraguay basin showed the highest number of records, i.e. 564 species, 309 not found in any other basin in Paraguay. The highest number of algal records are from the Humid Chaco ecoregion, with 610 species, 343 of which did not occur in any other ecoregion of the country. Our results indicate that Paraguay requires extensive research and human resource training programs in phycology.

The fish assemblages in Zostera in Western Port have been relatively well studied, but assemblages in locations with alternative habitats, and their spatial and temporal variability, have been poorly studied. This means that the ability of these locations to serve as refuge areas in periods of Zostera decline is unknown. Two primary sampling methods were used for sampling locations with alternative habitats. Underwater stereo video was used to sample locations with higher water clarity and dominated by Amphibolis, reef-macroalgae and rhodolith bed habitats. A mini otter trawl was used to sample locations with low water clarity and low relief bottom: one location was dominated by Caulerpa habitat and the other was a reference Zostera location. The results showed that many species that have previously been found to be common in Zostera seagrass were also found in Caulerpa habitat, and to a lesser extent with Amphibolis habitat. Most species were associated with multiple plant habitats although some were more specific, such as the Weedy Seadragon, Phyllopteryx taeniolatus, which was only recorded in Amphibolis habitat. Multivariate analysis indicated that fish community structure was very similar between the location with Caulerpa and the reference sub-tidal Zostera location. Smaller fish were more abundant at all locations in autumn reflecting the spring spawning period of most species. Overall, most species were not limited to associating with Zostera habitat and therefore locations with alternative structured habitats may provide a measure of refuge in the face of Zostera decline. This conclusion, however, can only be considered preliminary until there is a clearer understanding of the functional relationship between fish species and these alternative habitats. Any potential refuge value is likely to be limited for species with a specific preference for Zostera such as some pipefish species, or where species have larvae that settle primarily in shallow habitats or in locations dominated by Zostera.

For effective conservation management, biodiversity value needs to be a composite of biotic and abiotic factors. However, in the reserve design literature, conservation value is assigned with a limited set of metrics usually based on comprehensiveness, representativeness and persistence which may be insufficient at fully capturing biodiversity value. A group of conservation specialists in California, USA, used a multi-criteria decision making framework to elucidate and weight criteria for scoring biodiversity value at sites. A formal model for consensus and negotiation was applied to aggregate individuals' criteria weights across all group members. The group identified ecological condition, followed by biotic composition as the most important contributors to site conservation value. Long- and short-term threats causing fragmentation and degradation are also important criteria to consider. Key criteria are identified for which further data collection would serve the greatest purpose in prioritizing sites and the role of prioritization criteria in the larger context of systematic conservation planning is discussed. With the recognition that biodiversity value plays an important role in conservation decisions, the criteria presented here represents a comprehensive suite of factors to consider when assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. These can serve as an encompassing list which other groups can customize for the purpose of biodiversity evaluation for alternative conservation planning contexts.

However, tests of this premise have been constrained by data limitations, especially at large scales. Here we overcome this problem by combining large-scale citizen-sourced data with intensive expert observations of two endangered charismatic species, Blakiston's fish owl (forest specialist) and the red-crowned crane (wetland specialist). We constructed large-scale maps of species richness for 52 forest and 23 grassland/wetland bird species using hierarchical community modeling and citizen-sourced data at 1, 2, 5, and 10-km grid resolutions. We compared the species richness of forest and grassland/wetland birds between the breeding and non-breeding sites of the two charismatic birds at each of the four spatial resolutions, and then assessed the scale dependency of the biodiversity surrogates. Regardless of the habitat amounts, owl and crane breeding sites had higher forest and grassland/wetland bird species richness, respectively. However, this surrogacy was more effective at finer scales (1-2-km resolutions), which corresponds to the charismatic species' home range sizes (up to 9.4 +/- A 2.0 km(2) for fish owls, and 3-4 km(2) for cranes). Species richness showed the highest spatial variations at 1-2-km resolutions. We suggest that the agreement of functional scales between surrogate species and broader biodiversity is essential for successful surrogacy, and that habitat conservation and restoration targeting multiple charismatic species with different specialties can complement to biodiversity conservation.

In this paper, we examine how five predefined forest discourses (re)produced by Finnish forest owners treat nature and biodiversity conservation. Our critical discourse analysis combines qualitative content analysis with quantitative multivariate methods (NMDS). The data consists of in-depth interviews with 24 Finnish forest-owners. The five forest discourses formed a gradient from an absence of nature issues to a profound ecological pondering with deep affection and responsibility for nature. The discourses in between these two ends of the gradient contained narration on personal experiences but lacked the moral responsibility and deep theorizing typical of the nature-oriented discourse. The nature-oriented discourse proposed forest uses where the needs of nature were raised to a determining role whereas the other four discourses adhered to the standard economy-driven forest management paradigm. Both nature and the forest-owners with a strong relationship with nature appeared marginalised in the prevailing order of the forest discourses. The discoursal conditions that we evidenced did not favour biodiversity conservation among forest-owners. The results thus call for active forest policy that aims to transform the prevailing order of the discourses, but also tries to overcome the discoursal hinders for biodiversity conservation within the prevailing order.

Established in territories representative of different ecosystems but also of cultural diversity, protected areas in Mexico have historically been created and managed with a centralized rationale, creating several conflicts with local Communities over the use of natural resources. The Country's approach to protected areas perfectly illustrates the complexities, difficulties and challenges entailed in biodiversity conservation. This paper develops a critical analysis of this policy instrument in Mexico, and analyzes three Natural Protected Areas in the Yucatan Peninsula: The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, the Celestun Biosphere Reserve, and the Otoch Ma'ax Yetel Kooh Natural Protected Area. The case studies serve as examples of the most common difficulties that arise in Mexican Natural Protected Area policy: (1) uncoordinated public policies: (2) the usual Conflict between environmental authorities and local people over the management of natural resources; and (3) the exclusion of local people's perspectives, values and beliefs in conservation policy development and implementation.

Scientific consensus is limited to a few macroecological rules, such as species richness increasing with area, which provide limited guidance for conservation. In fact, few agreed ecological principles apply at the scale of sites or reserve management, partly because most community-level studies are restricted to single habitat types and species groups. We used the recently proposed ecospace framework and a comprehensive data set for aggregating environmental variation to predict multi-taxon diversity. We studied richness of plants, fungi and arthropods in 130 sites representing the major terrestrial habitat types in Denmark. We found the abiotic environment (ecospace position) to be pivotal for the richness of primary producers (vascular plants, mosses and lichens) and, more surprisingly, little support for ecospace continuity as a driver. A peak in richness at intermediate productivity adds new empirical evidence to a long-standing debate over biodiversity responses to productivity. Finally, we discovered a dominant and positive response of fungi and insect richness to organic matter accumulation and diversification (ecospace expansion). Two simple models of producer and consumer richness accounted for 77% of the variation in multi-taxon species richness suggesting a significant potential for generalization beyond individual species responses. Our study widens the traditional conservation focus on vegetation and vertebrate populations unravelling the importance of diversification of carbon resources for diverse heterotrophs, such as fungi and insects.

This paper argues for a context-driven approach whereby effective management requires inputs from both paradigms in different situations. A key element of context is understanding long-practiced resource tenures and their ability to meet future conservation and livelihood goals. Different types of tenure arrangements are often required for different resources. This approach is illustrated by analysis of Virachey National Park in NE Cambodia. This park encompasses part of the ancestral territory of ethnic Brao people, who rely upon swidden agriculture, fish, terrestrial wildlife, and various nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for their livelihoods. These people have developed a mix of resource tenure regimes to promote sustainable use and to maximize local benefits. In the face of contemporary pressures, some of these traditional approaches are effective, while others are not. The paper suggests avenues for building on long-established management practices of the Brao to achieve park management goals while enhancing the welfare of the Brao people. A mix of private ownership, common property management, and central government involvement may be required to maximize benefits to local people and ensure long-term protection of biodiversity."

The goal of the present work was a survey of the riparian beetles in the area, finding out or determining their role or importance in the ecosystem. The insects sampling technique used Barber traps, quadrates and hunting by sight. Quantitative and qualitative studies were carried out on four sampling sites. The current study allowed us to identify 26 significantly abundant beetle species. Human activities can be shown through the composition, abundance and spatio-temporal variation of the collected beetle community. As a reference tool our results would contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of this sensitive ecosystem and would provide elements for a conservation and sustainable development strategy.

In many biodiversity surveys, a small proportion of species require a disproportionate amount of a researcher's time and effort to detect or identify. If we are interested in predicting species diversity or composition, what are the consequences for statistical power of ignoring difficult species - that is, of surveying only a subset of the full suite of species? 2. We analysed 10 data sets on a variety of taxa, at different spatial scales, to assess correlations for species richness and species composition between a full data set and subsets of data with different numbers of species deleted at random, or according to the time investment required for inclusion. Power analyses characterized the trade-off between the number of sites surveyed and the completeness of the survey in each site. 3. For species richness, the majority of information regarding among-site patterns was retained even with large numbers of species removed. With only half the full species pool, the lower 95th percentile of correlations between the full vs. randomly generated reduced data sets was > 0.75 in all 10 cases. With 10% of the full species pool removed, correlations were 0.95. 4. Subsets of species were not as good at capturing among-site patterns of species composition (ordination scores and pairwise site dissimilarities). With half the full species pool, lower 95th percentile correlations between the full and randomly generated reduced data sets were as low as 0.1. Nonetheless, in most cases the lower 95th percentile correlation with half the number of species was > 0.7, and removing 10% of species gave correlations > 0.8 across all data sets. 5. For the three data sets in which species were also removed according to the time investment for inclusion, correlations fell within the range of variability observed for random species removals. 6. Synthesis and applications. In biological surveys, ignoring a relatively small proportion of species (e.g. < 10%), and often a much larger proportion, results in very little loss of information on patterns of biodiversity. As such, statistical power in many biodiversity studies may be maximized by eliminating difficult species from a survey in order to increase the number of sites surveyed.

In two recent papers, we found support for the hypothesis of an association between the occurrence of top predators and biodiversity. Such results were recently criticized. 2. Cabeza, Arponen & Van Teeffelen (2008) claim that the proper way to test the investigated relationship was to conduct a regional-level complementarity analysis that pools all predators across all habitat-types. However, such an approach may not help in assessing the performance of predators as surrogates for wider biodiversity, because: (a) management programmes on top predators almost invariably focus on a single species; (b) conservation planning and management often occur within habitats, not only across them; and (c) the required surveys and analyses may often be logistically unfeasible. Re-analysis of our data suggests that a different methodology would not change the results. 3. Kery, Royle & Schmid (2008) used data from a Swiss volunteers' monitoring scheme to claim that we missed a large number of species in our estimates of avian richness. However, we list 10 reasons why their calculations were inflated, given major differences in surface-coverage, habitat-sampling, field effort and in the way that secretive species were treated. Furthermore, our results for birds were replicated in analyses of butterflies and trees, which could not suffer from the same detectability biases. 4. Roth & Weber (2008) analysed the same Swiss database and found that a group of lower-trophic-level species (tits) out-performed raptors as indicators of butterfly richness (but not of bird richness). However, their analyses did not control for ecosystem identity, and data on raptor locations were of dubious quality. Furthermore, because tits are major caterpillar predators, the reported findings could have been expected on other grounds. 5. Synthesis and applications. We disagree with Cabeza and colleagues that local studies are of limited importance. Given the paucity of available information, many more local studies are needed to check the generality of the ecological pattern we found. Until further analyses become available, polarized positions for or against top predators as biodiversity indicators are premature. Meanwhile, like any tools, top predators should be employed in conservation decision-making with appropriate caution.

As technical planning tools, we utilized a forest management planning system (MELA) and the Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment (ToSIA) to visualize the impacts of the scenarios. We organized a stakeholder workshop where group discussions were used as a participatory method to get the stakeholder preferences and insights concerning forest resource use in the year 2030. Feedback from the workshop was then complemented with a questionnaire. Based on the results of the workshop and a questionnaire we developed three alternative forest resource scenarios: (1) bioenergy 2030 in which energy production is more centralized and efficient; (2) biodiversity 2030 - in which harvesting methods are more nature friendly and protected forests make up 10% of the total forest area; and (3) mixed bioenergy + biodiversity 2030 scenario - in which wood production, recreation and nature protection are assigned to the most suitable areas. The study showed that stakeholder engagement combined with the MELA and ToSIA tools can be a useful approach in scenario development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

New lagoons have been built using modern technologies to optimize water use and waste recycling, as well as increasing the green spaces around the country. To achieve successful development of these new lagoons, lessons should be learned from the old ponds by examining their biodiversity, ecology, and the roles played by aquatic plants and algae to remediate wastewaters at these ponds. The perspectives of using IWW (from oil and gas activities), that is currently pumped deep into the ground are presented. Instead of causing great damage to groundwater, IWW can be stored in artificial ponds prepared for ridding it of all impurities and pollutants of various types, organic and inorganic, thereby making it serviceable for various human uses. Phycoremediation, bioremediation, and phytoremediation methods adopted by algae, bacteria and aquatic native plants are discussed, and special attention should be paid to those that proved successful in removing heavy metals and degrading organic compounds. At least three native plants namely: Amaranthus viridis, Phragmites australis, and Typha domingensis should be paid special attention, since these plants are efficient in remediation of arsenic and mercury; elements found abundantly in wastewater of gas activities. Some promising modern and innovative experiences and biotechnologies to develop efficient transgenic plants and microorganisms in removing and degrading pollutants are discussed, as an important strategy to keep the ecosystem clean and safe. Novelty statement Industrial wastewater (IWW) could be an alternative source of water at the Arabian Gulf region. Currently, IWW is pumped deep into the ground causing a great damage to groundwater; little information about this issue has been reported. Such IWW can be stored in artificial ponds designed for ridding them of all impurities of various types; various remediation methods can be used. Modern biotechnology to develop transgenic plants and microorganisms to enhance these remediation methods can be adopted.	Al-Thani, R. F. ; Yasseen, B.

6582	WOS:000399116700039	Mapping global biodiversity connections with DNA barcodes: Lepidoptera of Pakistan	Plos One	3/24/2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0174749	12	Sequences from the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene are an effective tool for specimen identification and for the discovery of new species. The Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) (www.boldsystems.org) currently hosts 4.5 million records from animals which have been assigned to more than 490,000 different Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), which serve as a proxy for species. Because a fourth of these BINs derive from Lepidoptera, BOLD has a strong capability to both identify specimens in this order and to support studies of faunal overlap. DNA barcode sequences were obtained from 4503 moths from 329 sites across Pakistan, specimens that represented 981 BINs from 52 families. Among 379 species with a Linnaean name assignment, all were represented by a single BIN excepting five species that showed a BIN split. Less than half (44%) of the 981 BINs had counterparts in other countries; the remaining BINs were unique to Pakistan. Another 218 BINs of Lepidoptera from Pakistan were coupled with the 981 from this study before being compared with all 116,768 BINs for this order. As expected, faunal overlap was highest with India (21%), Sri Lanka (21%), United Arab Emirates (20%) and with other Asian nations (2.1%), but it was very low with other continents including Africa (0.6%), Europe (1.3%), Australia (0.6%), Oceania (1.0%), North America (0.1%), and South America (0.1%). This study indicates the way in which DNA barcoding facilitates measures of faunal overlap even when taxa have not been assigned to a Linnean species.

Many grasslands worldwide are undergoing succession to woody vegetation, causing complex effects on carbon (C) sequestration, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. Land managers are frequently tasked with maximizing ecosystem services and biodiversity. Nonetheless, there are few studies quantifying trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity during early woody succession. 2. We assessed the consequences of woody succession for C stocks, above-and below-ground taxa richness (plants, nematodes, mites, microbes, fungi), and soil ecosystem function at one site with a native tree, Kunzea ericoides, and one site with a non-native tree, Pinus nigra, both establishing in conservation grasslands. 3. Woody succession at both sites was associated with large gains in above-ground C stocks and, under P. nigra, losses from the mineral soil-C pool. 4. Taxa richness responses were complex, nonlinear and incongruent. While some taxa showed initial increases in richness with woody succession (e. g. plants), other taxa had rapid declines (e. g. plant-feeding and plant-associated nematodes, oribatid mites). 5. Below-ground ecosystem functioning shifted towards increased bacterial energy channels with woody succession, despite no change in bacterial or fungal biomass or fungal hyphal lengths. Most other soil measures were consistent with literature expectations (increased C: N ratios, release of recalcitrant phosphorus). 6. Synthesis and applications. Our gradient-based measurements of woody succession effects on ecosystems did not follow expectations based on comparing end-points of grasslands to homogeneous mature forest. The discordance of biodiversity responses across taxonomic groups suggests that managers cannot rely on the indicator-species concept to ensure conservation of cryptic biodiversity. Carbon sequestration and biodiversity followed non-congruent patterns, with significant losses of taxa richness from some functional groups during woody succession. Management to maximize individual ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration may therefore result in significant negative effects on biodiversity of some, but not all, taxa.

With interest in biodiversity offsets increasing in Latin America, we seek to strengthen the basis for policy development through a review of major environmental licensing policy frameworks in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Here we focused our review on an examination of national level policies to evaluate to which degree current provisions promote positive environmental outcomes. All the surveyed countries have national-level Environmental Impact Assessment laws or regulations that cover the habitats present in their territories. Although most countries enable the use of offsets only Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru explicitly require their implementation. Our review has shown that while advancing quite detailed offset policies, most countries do not seem to have strong requirements regarding impact avoidance. Despite this deficiency most countries have a strong foundation from which to develop policy for biodiversity offsets, but several issues require further guidance, including how best to: (1) ensure conformance with the mitigation hierarchy; (2) identify the most environmentally preferable offsets within a landscape context; (3) determine appropriate mitigation replacement ratios; and (4) ensure appropriate time and effort is given to monitor offset performance.

Triggered by the requirement of Water Framework Directive for a good ecological status for European river systems till 2015 and by still existing lacks in tools for cause identification of insufficient ecological status MODELKEY (http://www.modelkey.org), an Integrated Project with 26 partners from 14 European countries, was started in 2005. MODELKEY is the acronym for `Models for assessing and forecasting the impact of environmental key pollutants on freshwater and marine ecosystems and biodiversity'. The project is funded by the European Commission within the Sixth Framework Programme. Objectives. MODELKEY comprises a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing interlinked tools for an enhanced understanding of cause-effect-relationships between insufficient ecological status and environmental pollution as causative factor and for the assessment and forecasting of the risks of key pollutants on fresh water and marine ecosystems at a river basin and adjacent marine environment scale. New modelling tools for risk assessment including generic exposure assessment models, mechanistic models of toxic effects in simplified food chains, integrated diagnostic effect models based on community patterns, predictive component effect models applying artificial neural networks and GIS-based analysis of integrated risk indexes will be developed and linked to a user-friendly decision support system for the prioritisation of risks, contamination sources and contaminated sites. Approach. Modelling will be closely interlinked with extensive laboratory and field investigations. Early warning strategies on the basis of sub-lethal effects in vitro and in vivo are provided and combined with fractionation and analytical tools for effect-directed analysis of key toxicants. Integrated assessment of exposure and effects on biofilms, invertebrate and fish communities linking chemical analysis in water, sediment and biota with in vitro, in vivo and community level effect analysis is designed to provide data and conceptual understanding for risk arising from key toxicants in aquatic ecosystems and will be used for verification of various modelling approaches. Conclusion and Perspective. The developed tools will be verified in case studies representing European key areas including Mediterranean, Western and Central European river basins. An end-user-directed decision support system will be provided for cost-effective tool selection and appropriate risk and site prioritisation.

In this study, we use multiple vascular plant species diversity measures on alpha, beta and gamma levels to explore the linkage between biodiversity and co-located landforms (e.g. gullies, dunes and lake shores). We hypothesize that biodiversity will be positively related to geodiversity, which is founded on distinct landforms. Additionally, we propose that different landforms will sustain different amounts of biodiversity and that high alpha and gamma diversity values are related to landform-driven moisture availability whereas high beta diversity relates especially to landform-specific microtopographic variation. Location Rokua UNESCO Global Geopark area, Finland. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We compare vascular plant species richness measures, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, rarity-weighted richness and local contribution to beta diversity at altogether three levels of biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) for different landforms. Landform information is compiled from aerial photos, spatial data layers and targeted field surveys. We compare results to control habitat (i.e. sites without any distinct landforms) within the study area. Results Vascular plant diversity was higher on landforms than in control habitat. There was also notable variation between species diversity of different landforms. Moisture-rich gullies and river shores were especially diverse at all three levels, whereas aapa mires hosted most unique species composition (highest beta diversity). Beta diversity patterns were rather comparable with alpha and gamma diversity patterns, which contradict our hypothesis. Main conclusions This study quantitatively established a strong connection between terrestrial plant communities and multiple landforms. Our results highlighted the landform-controlled variation in soil moisture, microclimate and microtopography in enhancing plant species diversity. Based on the results, we promote the inclusion of landform-based geodiversity information in conservation management and in further biogeographical studies.

Here, we examine key forces affecting the dynamics of HMLs, and propose a framework connecting human disturbances, land use, and prospects for both tropical biodiversity and ecosystem services. We question the forest transition as a worldwide source of new secondary forest; the role played by regenerating (secondary) forest for biodiversity conservation, and the resilience of HMLs. We then offer a conceptual model describing potential successional trajectories among four major landscape types (natural, conservation, functional, and degraded) and highlight the potential implications of our model in terms of research agendas and conservation planning.

This may partly be due to a historical emphasis on wildlife protection, rather than on a broader science-based approach to conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A literature review of invasive plant species in India showed that nearly 60 % of all studies have been done since 2000, and only about 20 % of all studies are from protected areas. Studies from protected areas have largely focused on a small subset of invasive alien plants, and almost half these studies are on a single species, Lantana camara, probably reflecting the species' ubiquitous distribution. The spread of alien plants in India has been both ecologically and human mediated. Efforts to manage plant invasions have, in the past, been diluted by the ambivalence of managers attempting to find beneficial uses for these species. Despite growing knowledge about the harmful impacts of certain invasive plants on native species and ecosystems, their deliberate spread has continued, even till quite recently. And, despite the successful implementation of management initiatives in some protected areas, these efforts have not expanded to other areas. The lack of a national coordinated effort for invasive species monitoring, research, and management largely underlies this.

However, data involving advanced molecular cytogenetics or comparative genomics are yet largely limited for this fish group. Therefore, the present investigations focus on the osteoglossiform family Arapaimidae, studying a unique fish model group with advanced molecular cytogenetic genomic tools. The aim is to better explore and clarify certain events and factors that had impact on evolutionary history of this fish group. For that, both South American and African representatives of Arapaimidae, namely Arapaima gigas and Heterotis niloticus, were examined. Both species differed markedly by diploid chromosome numbers, with 2n = 56 found in A. gigas and 2n = 40 exhibited by H. niloticus. Conventional cytogenetics along with fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed some general trends shared by most osteoglossiform species analyzed thus far, such as the presence of only one chromosome pair bearing 18S and 5S rDNA sites and karyotypes dominated by acrocentric chromosomes, resembling thus the patterns of hypothetical ancestral teleost karyotype. Furthermore, the genomes of A. gigas and H. niloticus display remarkable divergence in terms of repetitive DNA content and distribution, as revealed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). On the other hand, genomic diversity of single copy sequences studied through principal component analyses (PCA) based on SNP alleles genotyped by the DArT seq procedure demonstrated a very low genetic distance between the South American and African Arapaimidae species; this pattern contrasts sharply with the scenario found in other osteoglossiform species. Underlying evolutionary mechanisms potentially explaining the obtained data have been suggested and discussed.	de Oliveira, Ezequiel Aguiar ; Carlos Bertollo, Luiz Antonio ; Rab, Petr ; Ezaz, Tariq ; Yano, Cassia Fernanda ; Hatanaka, Terumi ; Jegede, Oladele Ilesanmi ; Tanomtong, Alongklod ; Liehr, Thomas ; Sember, Alexandr ; Maruyama, Sandra Regina ; Feldberg, Eliana ; Viana, Patrik Ferreira ; Cioffiid, Marcelo de Bello	14	2928086 ; 137674 ; 42644154 ; 889805 ; 2202228 ; 1991444 ; 10118421 ; 371218 ; 11113 ; 3871415 ; 2651157 ; 542629 ; 6631810 ; 32673372	Brazil ; Brazil ; Czech Republic ; Australia ; Nigeria ; Thailand ; Germany ; Brazil	NA	2019	Marija Miliƒçiƒá	yes	Afrotropical ; Neotropical	Africa, South America	NA	Freshwater	NA	Field sampling ; Other	0	1	Lab analyses	Biodiversity ...

The extension was aimed to remedy a serious application limitation of the traditional SAR that only addressed one aspect of biodiversity scaling-species richness scaling over space, but ignoring species abundance information. The extension was further inspired by a recent consensus that Hill numbers offer the most appropriate measures for alpha-diversity and multiplicative beta-diversity. In particular, Hill numbers are essentially a series of Renyi's entropy values weighted differently along the rare-common-dominant spectrum of species abundance distribution and are in the units of effective number of species (or species equivalents such as OTUs). I therefore postulate that Hill numbers should follow the same or similar law of the traditional SAR. I test the postulation with the American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1,473 healthy North American individuals. I further propose three new concepts and develop their statistical estimation formulae based on the new DAR extension, including: (i) DAR profile-z-q relationship (DAR scaling parameter z at different diversity order q), (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile-g-q relationship (PDO parameter g at order q, and (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity: D-max) profile-D-max-q. While the classic SAR is a special case of our new DAR profile, the PDO and MAD profiles offer novel tools for analyzing biodiversity (including alpha-diversity and beta-diversity) and biogeography over space.

We analyzed land use and land cover changes in the Otoch Ma'ax Yetel Koch NPA in the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, where Yucatec Maya recently incorporated ecotourism to their set of economic activities. We evaluated changes in land use using vegetation maps from 1999 to 2003 and predicted vegetation cover in 2011 by developing a cellular automata and Markovian chains model. We observed slight increases in the area covered by medium stages of secondary succession, while new milpa plots appeared in areas of all succession stages. We used three scenarios to predict land cover in 2011: (a) milpa agriculture implemented at the same rate; (b) milpa agriculture decreases due to the growing demand of ecotourism; and (c) milpa agriculture disappears due to parceling of communally owned land. All scenarios predict slight increases in the area covered by secondary succession at the expense of milpas or younger stages of succession, with no major differences between the three predictive scenarios.

8977	WOS:000311762700013	BIODIVERSITY, WATER CHEMISTRY, PHYSICAL CHARACTERISITCS AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE GRADIENTS OF SANDSTONE SPRINGS ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU	Western North American Naturalist	11/01/2012	NA	6	Springs located on the Colorado Plateau are highly threatened and represent a small percentage of the landscape; yet they are disproportionately important to diverse native flora and fauna. The relationships between anthropogenic disturbance, aquatic macroinvertebrate species composition, and environmental variables at these springs have received little study. We selectively visited 40 sandstone springs in southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado to span a range of impacts. We classified the springs into impact categories based on a spring impact score, we measured biodiversity (aquatic macroinvertebrates), water chemistry (nutrients, dissolved O-2, pH, specific conductivity, temperature, turbidity, coliform bacteria [Escherichia coli]), physical characters (solar radiation, substrate, vegetation cover, bank stability, discharge), and presence of anthropogenic disturbance. Escherichia coli abundance was higher in high impact categories, and turbidity increased with increasing disturbance. No differences in total N, total P, specific conductivity, flow, dissolved O-2, pH, or substrate were found among the impact categories. Vegetation cover was higher in low impact categories than in moderate and high impact categories, while potential annual and growing-season solar radiation was lower in low impact categories than in high impact categories. Global and subsequent multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) comparisons suggested strong differences in aquatic macroinvertebrates between low and high impact springs and no difference at moderate impact springs. Mean taxa richness (alpha-diversity), total taxa richness (gamma-diversity), and percent of taxa richness composed of shredders peaked at moderate disturbance levels. The percentage of non-insect taxa richness was reduced in high impact categories, and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) were higher in low impact categories than in high impact categories. All high impact springs had both livestock use and vehicle use (roads or vehicles), and our data suggest that disturbances caused by one or both of these uses alter the aquatic macroinvertebratc assemblage. We suggest that disturbance may increase macroinvertehrate richness, where a mix of tolerant alld intolerant species co-occur until macroinvertebrate richness reaches a threshold; after surpassing this threshold, macroinvertebrate diversity decreases.

We evaluated reduced-feeding strategies for improving production efficiency of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In a 12-week pond trial, fish were fed daily, every other day, every third day, or not at all. Ponds were fertilized to enhance natural foods. In a fifth group fish were fed daily without pond fertilization. Fish fed daily with or without pond fertilization and fish fed every other day had higher specific growth rates, survivability, and net production than the other two treatments. Fish feed efficiency and benefit to cost ratio was highest for treatments fed in a pulsatile manner (i.e. fed every other day or every third day) with fish fed on alternate days providing the best net return among all groups. Fish fed on alternate days had more moderate gene expression levels of intestinal nutrient transporters which may allow for a more balanced and efficient nutrient uptake. Fecal microbe analyses identified 145 families of prokaryotic and 132 genera of eukaryotic organisms in tilapia. The highest diversity of prokaryotes was found in fish fed either every other day or daily in fertilized ponds and the highest diversity of eukaryotes was found in fish fed every other day. These studies indicate feeding Nile tilapia on alternate days along with weekly pond fertilization has no deleterious effects on growth, survivability, or production versus daily feeding regimes, but enhances feed efficiency by 76% and provides the greatest net return on investments. Our studies also suggest for the first time that combining alternate-day feeding with pond fertilization produces the greatest microbial biodiversity in the intestine that could contribute to enhanced feed efficiency and overall health of tilapia.

Maintaining and protecting biodiversity for the future under changing environmental and sociopolitical conditions is a major challenge. Scenarios are used as decision-making aids for natural resource management at local to global scales. Scenarios are underutilised by conservationists at a local level, where they can be highly effective for anticipating change. 2. People's values and attitudes are crucial in determining the future, yet they are rarely placed at the centre of scenario exercises. Novel methods have been developed to fully integrate people's worldviews into scenario planning. The ethnographic futures framework focuses on how changes occur through human agency and how they will be felt by society in the future. The three horizons approach considers how different ideas and paradigms become more, or less, dominant in society over time. 3. Natural England (NE), the statutory adviser to the UK Government on the natural environment in England, carried out a scenario planning process using these novel approaches. The scenarios consider a wide range of global and local factors and investigate their impact upon the natural environment in England, to 2060. 4. A set of four contrasting scenarios was produced. Despite their differences, nature was always highly valued in some form; ultimately, the state of the natural environment was determined not by natural forces but by societal choice. 5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning allows the development of key visions for the future. These can be used to establish, and influence, the direction of future trends and their impacts on the natural environment, particularly in the context of a shifting basis for conservation policy that seeks to enhance ecological resilience. The scenarios are being used within NE to help local communities shape the future of their natural environment; this process can be utilised by governments or environmental agencies elsewhere. This study demonstrates that across a range of scenarios the future state of the natural environment is very much a matter of societal choice. Decision-making frameworks for environmental conservation must take proper account of ecological knowledge, societal values, foresight and complexity.

A number of them have been focused on interspecific competition for resources, mainly nutrients and light, and have stressed the role of the dispersal as a key mechanism in understanding community patterns. In our approach we introduced a cellular automaton computer model in an effort to quantify the community processes taking into account the spatial dimension of the problem of dispersal. We simulated the responses of natural communities to gap creation after a disturbance (e.g. fire) and looked at the resulting community dynamics. Our results showed that an increase of the biodiversity in the sense of adding more species in the species pool of the communities under study followed a positive response in our system viewed from a productivity point. Also the responses varied as disturbance intensity increased, indicating that species-specific characteristics could dominate the end communities.

Their ecological importance can be assessed through plant biodiversity and such ecosystem functions as primary productivity and nitrate removal capacity. Multivariate analysis were used to establish a hierarchy of environmental factors related to he vegetation structure and diversity. Four different measures of plant diversity (both structural and functional) were made on a Seine River wetland. Key functions of estuarine floodplain (productivity and denitrification capacity) were either measured directly or assessed using remotely sensed data. The richest plant communities correspond to mesophilous grasslands which have an intermediate position between natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes. These species assemblages occur in ecosystems presenting both a regular productivity in time and space and the highest denitrification potentiality.

Still, much uncertainty exists about how individual and population-level traits of these species contribute to ecosystem processes and how engineering species jointly affect biodiversity. In this manipulative field experiment, we examined how biodiversity in marginal blue mussel beds is affected by blue mussel (1) body size, density and patch context and (2) presence of fucoid and algal structures. In the study area, bladder-wrack (Fucus vesiculosus), filamentous algae and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) coexist at shallow depths in a variety of patch configurations and offer complex habitats with a high variability of resources. We hypothesized that complexity in terms of mussel bed structure and algal presence determines species composition and abundance. Results from the experiment were compared with macrofaunal communities found in natural populations of both engineering species. Results show that the physical structure and blue mussel patch context are important determinants for species composition and abundance. Results further show that the presence of algal structures positively affects diversity in blue mussel habitats due to increased surface availability and complexity that these algae offer. This study shows that blue mussel beds at the very margin of their distribution have an indisputable function for promoting and maintaining biodiversity and suggest that facilitative effects of habitat-modifying species are important on Baltic Sea rocky shores with fundamental importance to community structure.

1390	WOS:000167876900008	Selecting herb-rich forest networks to protect different measures of biodiversity	Ecological Applications	04/01/2001	NA	11	Data on vascular plants of herb-rich forests in Finland were used to compare the efficiency of reserve selection methods in representing three measures of biodiversity: species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and restricted-range diversity. Comparisons of reserve selection methods were carried out both with and without consideration of the existing reserve system. Our results showed that the success of a reserve network of forests in representing different measures of biodiversity depends on the selection procedure, selection criteria, and data set used. Ad hoc selection was the worst option. A scoring procedure was generally more efficient than maximum random selection. Heuristic methods also appeared to be efficient. Each biodiversity measure can be used as a criterion for a selection algorithm and as a measure of efficiency of protection at the network level. The results indicate that different measures of biodiversity should be taken into account. For instance, phylogenetic diversity of a network was maximized by a heuristic method using phylogenetic diversity as the selection criterion. However, a heuristic method based on restricted-range diversity was more efficient than that based on species richness in representing high species richness in a forest network. Our results showed also that complementing the existing reserves is less efficient than selection starting with a blank slate. That is, the total number of sites required to protect a given level of biodiversity is higher when complementing the existing network, because some previously protected sites contribute relatively little diversity to the network. Data on species of a historic network should be available when new sites are selected for complementing the historic network.

Despite their increasing use, little quantitative data are available on what species and habitats conservation easements aim to protect, how much structural development they allow, or what types of land use they commonly permit. Too address these knowledge gaps, we surveyed staff responsible for 119 conservation easements established by the largest nonprofit easement holder, The Nature Conservancy, between 1985 and 2004. Most easements (80%) aimed to provide core habitat to protect species or communities on-site, and nearly all were designed to reduce development. Conservation easements also allowed for a wide range of private uses, which may result in additional fragmentation and habitat disturbance. Some residential or commercial use, new structures, or subdivision of the property were permitted on 85% of sampled conservation easements. Over half (56%) allowed some additional buildings, of which 60% restricted structure size or building area. Working landscape easements with ranching, forestry, or farming made up nearly half (46%) of the easement properties sampled and were more likely than easements without these uses to be designated as buffers to enhance biodiversity in the surrounding area. Our results demonstrate the need for clear restrictions on building and subdivision in easements, research on the compatibility of private uses on easement land, and greater public understanding of the trade-offs implicit in the use of conservation easements for biodiversity conservation.

2324	WOS:000335809300028	Typology of Public Outreach for Biodiversity Conservation Projects in Spain	Conservation Biology	06/01/2014	10.1111/cobi.12220	8	Conservation education and outreach programs are a key approach to promote public understanding of the importance of biodiversity conservation. We reviewed 85 biodiversity conservation projects supported by the Spanish Ministry of Environment's Biodiversity Foundation. Through content analysis and descriptive statistics, we examined how the projects carried out communication, education, and public awareness and participation (CEPA) actions. We also used multivariate statistical analysis to develop a typology of 4 classes of biodiversity conservation projects on the basis of CEPA implementation. The classifications were delineated by purpose of CEPA, level of integration of CEPA actions, type of CEPA goals, main CEPA stakeholders, and aim of conservation. Our results confirm the existence of 2 key positions: CEPA has intrinsic value (i.e., they supposed the implementation of any CEPA action indirectly supported conservation) and CEPA is an instrument for achieving conservation goals. We also found that most CEPA actions addressed general audiences and school children, ignored minority groups and women, and did not include evaluation. The characteristics of the 4 types of projects and their frequency of implementation in the sample reflect the need for better integration of different types of actions (communication, education, and participation) and improved fostering of participation of multiple stakeholders in developing policy and implementing management strategies. Tipologia de la Divulgacion Publica para Proyectos de Conservacion de la Biodiversidad en Espana Resumen Los programas de educacion y divulgacion para la conservacion son un acercamiento clave para promover el entendimiento publico de la importancia de la conservacion de la biodiversidad. Revisamos 85 proyectos de conservacion ejecutados con el apoyo de la Fundacion Biodiversidad del Ministerio de Medio Ambiente Espanol. Por medio del analisis de contenido y estadistica descriptiva examinamos como los proyectos llevan a cabo acciones de comunicacion, educacion, conciencia publica y participacion (CEPA). Tambien usamos analisis estadisticos multivariados para desarrollar una tipologia de cuatro tipos de proyectos de conservacion con base en la implementacion de CEPA. Las clasificaciones fueron delineadas a partir del proposito de CEPA, el nivel de integracion de acciones de CEPA, el tipo de objetivos de CEPA, principales destinatarios/as de CEPA y los objetivos de conservacion. Nuestros resultados confirman la existencia de dos posiciones clave: CEPA con valor intrinseco (la cual presupone que la implementacion de cualquier accion CEPA apoya indirectamente la conservacion) y CEPA como instrumento para la consecucion de objetivos de conservacion. Tambien descubrimos que la mayoria de acciones CEPA se dirigen al publico en general y escolares, ignoran a grupos minoritarios y mujeres, y no incluyen una evaluacion. Las caracteristicas de los cuatro tipos de proyectos y su frecuencia de implementacion en la muestra reflejan la necesidad de una mejor integracion de los diferentes tipos de acciones (comunicacion, educacion y participacion) y de una mejora en el fomento de la participacion de multiples destinatarios/as en el desarrollo de politicas y la implementacion de estrategias de gestion.

2878	WOS:000172692900020	A systematic test of an enterprise strategy for community-based biodiversity conservation	Conservation Biology	12/01/2001	NA	140	"A commonly held belief is that if people can benefit financially from enterprises that depend on nearby forests, reefs, and other natural habitats, then they will take action to conserve and sustainably use them. The Biodiversity Conservation Network brought together conservation and development organizations and local communities to systematically test this hypothesis across 39 conservation project sites in Asia and the Pac ftc. Each project implemented one or more community-based enterprises such as setting up an ecotourism lodge, distilling essential oils from wild plant roots, producing jams and jellies from forest fruits, harvesting timber, or collecting marine samples to test for pharmaceutical compounds. Each project team collected the biological, enterprise, and social data necessary to test the network's hypothesis. We present the results of this test. We found that a community-based enterprise strategy can lead to conservation, but only under limited conditions and never on its own. We summarize the specific conditions under which an enterprise strategy will and will not work in a decision chart that can be used by project managers to determine whether this strategy might make sense at their site. We also found that an enterprise strategy can be subsidized and still create a net gain that pays for conservation. Based on our experiences, we recommend developing ""learning portfolios"" that combine action and research to test other conservation strategies."

When the dispersal rate of soil animals was taken into account, quite opposite trends were displayed by species having poor or high dispersal capabilities. At the local level, species with short legs, non functional jumping apparatus and reduction of visual organs were distinguished against by landuse diversity, while species with long legs, functional jumping apparatus (furcula) and complete eyes, thus able to disperse at the soil surface, were not. It was verified, through aerial photographs taken 50 years ago, that landuse changes, expected to be more frequent in heterogeneous landscapes, may contribute to explain this phenomenon.

To maximize the return on investment in freshwater conservation with limited financial resources, managers must prioritize management actions that are most cost-effective. However, little is known about what these priorities may be under the combined effects of climate and land-cover change. We present a novel decision-making framework for prioritizing conservation resources to different management actions for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. The approach is novel in that it has the ability to model interactions, rank management options for dealing with conservation threats from climate and land-cover change, and integrate empirical data with expert knowledge. We illustrate the approach using a case study in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia under climate change, land-cover change and their combined effects. Our results show that the explicit inclusion of multiple threats and costs results in quite different priorities than when costs and interactions are ignored. When costs are not considered, stream and riparian restoration, as a single management strategy, provides the greatest overall protection of macroinvertebrate and fish richness in rural and urban areas of SEQ in response to climate change and/or urban growth. Whereas, when costs are considered, farm/land management with stream and riparian restoration are the most cost-effective strategies for macroinvertebrate and fish conservation. Our findings support riparian restoration as the most effective adaptation strategy to climate change and urban development, but because it is expensive it may often not be the most cost-efficient strategy. Our approach allows for these decisions to be evaluated explicitly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A nearest-neighbour cluster analysis of pair-wise comparisons of species composition data (Jaccard index of similarity) from these geographical units is presented. Four main geographical regions were identified: holarctic, subantarctic/Australian, oceanian, and pantropical. Possible changes of the global species number caused by increasing availability of molecular data are discussed. A prospect on future developments of lichen biodiversity research is provided.

To investigate how coevolutionary interactions are shaped within species-rich communities, we characterized the architecture of an array of quantitative, mutualistic networks spanning a broad geographic range. These coevolutionary networks are highly asymmetric, so that if a plant species depends strongly on an animal species, the animal depends weakly on the plant. By using a simple dynamical model, we showed that asymmetries inherent in coevolutionary networks may enhance long-term coexistence and facilitate biodiversity maintenance.

For Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes, however, centres of high species richness and centres of high endemicity are not concordant. Moreover ranges are not, on average, smaller inside the Central Indo-Pacific (CI-P) biodiversity hotspot. The disparity between richness and endemicity arises because corals and reef fishes have strongly skewed range distributions, with many species being very widespread. Consequently, the largest ranges overlap to generate peaks in species richness near the equator and the CI-P biodiversity hotspot, with only minor contributions from endemics. Furthermore, we find no relationship between the number of coral vs. fish endemics at locations throughout the Indo-Pacific, even though total richness of the two groups is strongly correlated. The spatial separation of centres of endemicity and biodiversity hotspots in these taxa calls for a two-pronged management strategy to address conservation needs.

Sabans traditionally fished on the Bank as far back as 1907, but increasing foreign fishing pressures on the Bank in the 1970s and 1980s forced many Saban fishermen out. Concerns were compounded by the suspicion that shipping was also damaging the benthic habitat of the bank. Fishery legislation, enacted in 1996, brought an end to unlicensed fishing and established Coast Guard enforcement on the Bank, but also led to protests from neighboring countries that previously fished on the Bank. Research was necessary to support the need for protection. Review of available research of Saba Bank and rapid biological assessments and fisheries surveys since 1996 emphasized the richness of Saba Bank's biodiversity and the need for protection of fisheries stocks. The national nature policy plan recognized this and encouraged further research to base conservation measures on. Recent biological surveys of corals, fishes, and algae presented in this collection of articles emphasized habitat heterogeneity and the relative richness of the marine flora and fauna. These assessments formed the basis for a management plan to protect Saba Bank's biodiversity and a draft proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) seeking Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) status for the Bank. The intention of the PSSA proposal is to protect the benthic habitat on Saba Bank from anchor damage. This paper serves to provide the context for the results of the recent biodiversity surveys of Saba Bank. It is hoped that this collection will serve as a knowledge baseline and engender further research in the area.

Although local people may be strongly affected by these decisions, there are problems related to external professionals' understanding of how such decisions might affect the livelihoods of local residents. And despite the worldwide move towards more 'participatory' methods, there are still problems in finding ways to consult local people to find out which areas they themselves would like to conserve.

Intercomparison of two major German project databases for interdisciplinary collaborative functional biodiversity research	Ecological Informatics	03/01/2012	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.11.004	9	Research on biodiversity, its relation to ecosystem functioning and services, and the assessment of the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity needs an interdisciplinary perspective. This implies a great diversity of data and data formats gathered mostly in short- to mid-term collaborative research projects. It has been common practice that projects develop specific data management and communication solutions. We compare solutions of two major German collaborative research programs in functional biodiversity research to derive functional commonalities. This in-depth analysis follows five categories of the data life cycle: (i) data acquisition, (ii) metadata management, (iii) database, (iv) exploration, analysis and visualization, and (v) data curation and preservation. The results show that even though both systems were developed completely independently, they reveal comparable overall features and a similar state of implementation. Major focus areas lie in the implementation of comparable metadata schemas and their importance for storage and access strategies for tabular data on the value level. Basic analysis tools and similar management functions are considered. Intensive communication with the users and the orientation of ongoing developments based on user requirements is also important. Both systems are different mostly in specific details which, however, do not influence the overall comparable performance. It should be also emphasized that the same functionality is achieved with completely different software. The choice of software is based on the evaluation of available technologies. Thereby it might be influenced by individual experiences of the developers, but is mainly determined by the data diversity, which forces the usage of flexible technologies to develop adaptable systems. It is concluded that overall features for project databases of collaborative research projects must be supplemented by sophisticated data description, storage, and analysis structures to serve the requirements of integrative functional biodiversity research.

The study was conducted in 2013 on six tributaries of the Upper Sukhona River. Five sampling sites were in different parts of the Vologda River and five sites on small rivers, Losta, Lukhta, Komya, Chernyj Shingar, and Belyj Shingar (one site per river). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos were sampled six times, from April to October, and macrophytes were studied in August. hi total, 469 species of aquatic organisms were found in the tributaries of the Upper Sukhona River, belonging to the following phyla: Cyanophyta (5 species), Chrysophyta (8), Bacillariophyta (62), Xanthophyta (1), Cryptophyta (10), Dinophyta (4), Euglenophyta (12), Chlorophyta (17), Streptophyta (1), Bryophyta (2), Marchantiophyta (3), Equisetophyta (1), Magnoliophyta (63), Rotifera (22), Cnidaria (1), Platyhelmintes (1), Annelida (29), Mollusca (33), Arthropoda (194). The maximum number of species was found in the Vologda River, the largest of all the tributaries. The number of zoobenthos species was similar at different sites in the Vologda River and in the small rivers. The number of species of other groups of aquatic organisms in the small rivers was lower than those registered in the Vologda River. The greatest number of macrophyte and zoobenthos species was recorded in the Upper Vologda River and Belyj Shingar River, where the flow is strong all the year round. The greatest number of phyto- and zooplankton species was found at the extra-city sites where current is almost absent hi the dam backwater, species richness was higher than that registered downstream of the dam. At the same time, the species richness of macrophytes and zoobenthos in the dam backwater was lower. The smallest number of species was found in the Vologda River, downstream of the city of Vologda. Decreases in the species richness and Shannon's biodiversity index were witnessed in the Vologda River city site and in the small rivers, as they get closer to the city. Cluster analyses performed for the studied groups of aquatic organisms showed dissimilar results; however, the studied sites on the Vologda River having the highest anthropogenic load formed a cluster. Aquatic organisms of the Upper Sukhona tributaries experience both natural (flow velocity and size of the watercourse) and anthropogenic factors (proximity to the city and flow regulation).

Plos One	10/19/2011	10.1371/journal.pone.0025762	19	The concept of biodiversity offsets is well established as an approach to environmental management. The concept has been suggested for environmental management in fisheries, particularly in relation to the substantial numbers of non-target species-seabirds in particular-caught and killed as incidental bycatch during fishing activities. Substantial areas of fisheries are being closed to protect these species at great cost to the fishing industry. However, other actions may be taken to offset the impact of fishing on these populations at lower cost to the fishing industry. This idea, however, has attracted severe criticism largely as it does not address the underlying externality problems created by the fishing sector, namely seabird fishing mortality. In this paper, we re-examine the potential role of compensatory mitigation as a fisheries management tool, although from the perspective of being an interim management measure while more long-lasting solutions to the problem are found. We re-model an example previously examined by both proponents and opponents of the approach, namely the cost effectiveness of rodent control relative to fishery area closures for the conservation of a seabird population adversely affected by an Australian tuna fishery. We find that, in the example being examined, invasive rodent eradication is at least 10 times more cost effective than area closures. We conclude that, while this does not solve the actual bycatch problem, it may provide breathing space for both the seabird species and the industry to find longer term means of reducing bycatch.

8061	WOS:000245934700006	Effects of cutting and nitrogen deposition on biodiversity in Cantabrian heathlands	Applied Vegetation Science	04/01/2007	NA	23	Questions: Does the diversity of heathland vegetation change when subjected to experimental disturbances such as cutting and nitrogen fertilization? Do changes in the vegetation structure negatively affect the regeneration of the dominant species Calluna vulgaris? Is cutting an alternative method of conserving the diversity and maintaining the structure of heathlands in the Canabrian Mountains? Location: Calluna vulgaris heathlands on the southern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountain range, NW Spain. Methods: A total of 60 plots were treated with different combinations of cutting and twice the estimated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (56 kg-N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). The changes in the cover values of the species present were monitored over a five year study period. The cover values were used to calculate abundance and species richness. Results: Fertilizing, with nitro-en allows biodiversity to increase over time. However, the greatest biodiversity is associated with the cutting plus fertilization treatment, since cutting allows gaps to be opened that are easily colonized by pioneer annual species, white fertilization mainly favours an increase in the mean number of perennial herbs (graminoids and forbs). Increased perennial herb richness also corresponds to a rise in their cover values. The recovery of the dominant woody species in these communities, Calluna vulgaris, is not impeded by the increase in perennial herbs species' cover values. Conclusions: In the Calluna vulgaris heathlands studied, cutting plus fertilization allowed an increase in biodiversity over time. No displacement of the dominant woody species, Calluna vulgaris, is observed due to the presence of the perennial herbs. Cutting patches of heathland is recommended as a mechanism for maintaining high vegetation diversity, when grazing is not possible.

Here we present the first global assessment of current and potential future impacts on biodiversity of a habitat loss and fragmentation-climate change (HLF-CC) interaction. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the negative impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation have been disproportionately severe in areas with high temperatures in the warmest month and declining rainfall, although impacts also varied across vegetation types. We compiled an integrated global database of past, current and future climate variables and past vegetation loss to identify ecoregions where (i) past climate change is most likely to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF, and (ii) forecasted climate change is most likely to exacerbate the impacts of HLF in the future. We found that recent climate change is likely (probability >66%) to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF in 120 (18.5%) ecoregions. Impacted ecoregions are disproportionately biodiverse, containing over half (54.1%) of all known terrestrial amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species. Forecasts from the RCP8.5 emissions scenario suggest that nearly half of ecoregions globally (n = 283, 43.5%) will become impacted during the 21st century. To minimize ongoing and future HLF-CC impacts on biodiversity, ecoregions where impacts are most likely must become priorities for proactive conservation actions that avoid loss of native vegetation (e.g., protected area establishment). Highly degraded ecoregions where impacts are most likely should be priorities for restoration and candidates for unconventional conservation actions (e.g. translocation of species).

The area has a long geologic history and a central biogeographic location with a complex circulation ensuring oceanographic connectivity with the Mediterranean Sea, equatorial and North Atlantic regions. The geodynamics of the region promotes a notorious diversity in the seep regime despite the relatively low fluxes of hydrocarbon-rich gases. We analyse quantitative samples taken during the cruises TTR14, TTR15 and MSM01-03 in seven mud volcanoes grouped into Shallow MVs (Mercator: 350 m, Kidd: 500 m, Meknes: 700 m) and Deep MVs (Captain Arutyunov: 1300 m, Carlos Ribeiro: 2200 m, Bonjardim: 3000 m, Porto: 3900 m) and two additional Reference sites (ca. 550 m). Macrofauna (retained by a 500 mu m sieve) was identified to species level whenever possible. The samples yielded modest abundances (70-1567 individuals per 0.25m(2)), but the local and regional number of species is among the highest ever reported for cold seeps. Among the 366 recorded species, 22 were symbiont-hosting bivalves (Thyasiridae, Vesicomyidae, Solemyidae) and tubeworms (Siboglinidae). The multivariate analyses supported the significant differences between Shallow and Deep MVs: The environmental conditions at the Shallow MVs make them highly permeable to the penetration of background fauna leading to high diversity of the attendant assemblages (H': 2.92-3.94; ES(100): 28.3-45.0; J': 0.685-0.881). The Deep MV assemblages showed, in general, contrasting features but were more heterogeneous (H': 1.41-3.06; ES(100): 10.5-30.5; J': 0.340-0.852) and often dominated by one or more siboglinid species. The rarefaction curves confirmed the differences in biodiversity of Deep and Shallow MVs as well as the convergence of the latter to the Reference sites. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity demonstrated the high beta-diversity of the assemblages, especially in pairwise comparisons involving samples from the Deep MVs. Diversity partitioning assessed for species richness, Hurlbert's expected number of species and Shannon-Wiener index confirmed the high beta-diversity across different spatial scales (within MVs, between MVs, between Deep and Shallow MVs).

This is a 725 km, largely forested, Paleozoic limestone escarpment that, excepting the Great Lakes, is the most prominent topographical feature of southern Ontario, Canada. Results show highly significant differences in mean site size and extent of forest interior among natural areas of different ownership classes, with larger and more forested sites being under mixed (private + public) ownership, but no significant difference between sites of public and private ownership. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that after controlling for differences in landscape-level factors (total size of natural area, extent of forest interior, extent of landform heterogeneity and geographic location), most measures of biotic diversity (including the number of vegetation community types, provincially rare vascular plants, and regionally and locally rare breeding birds) differed significantly among sites of private, public and mixed ownership. In general, values at public and mixed ownership sites were greatest, with significantly lower biodiversity values at privately-owned sites. Furthermore it would seem not to be a product of public bodies having historically purchased the largest sites or most-forested sites, since there is no significant difference between the mean size of publically-owned and privately-owned sites. Results of stepwise multiple regression confirm the well known relation between size of a natural area and variation in both total, and rare species diversity. Since public sites have generally more species than private sites, they are essential elements of any conservation network.

Most drainage ditches are considered artificial waterbodies and are not typically included in routine monitoring programmes, and as a result the faunal and floral communities they support are poorly quantified. This paper characterises the aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of agricultural drainage ditches managed by an internal drainage board in Lincolnshire, UK. The drainage ditches support very diverse macroinvertebrate communities at both the site (alpha diversity) and landscape scale (gamma diversity) with the main arterial drainage ditches supporting greater numbers of taxa when compared to smaller side ditches. Examination of the between site community heterogeneity (beta diversity) indicated that differences among ditches were high spatially and temporally. The results illustrate that both main arterial and side ditches make a unique contribution to aquatic biodiversity of the agricultural landscape. Given the need to maintain drainage ditches to support agriculture and flood defence measures, we advocate the application of principles from 'reconciliation ecology' to inform the future management and conservation of drainage ditches.

We studied the peculiar case of the lower, French section of the Moselle River where 20 invertebrate species have been introduced since 1854, with a rate increasing exponentially with time. Dredge sampling performed in 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2001 at four sampling stations allowed for an evaluation of faunal changes in terms of composition, structure and function. During this period, no structural changes were recorded in spite of multiple, new and successful introductions. The evaluation of functional modifications was based on a typology of taxa exhibiting homogeneous biological/ecological traits. Functional diversity, measured as the diversity of taxa distribution among functional groupings, revealed a significant increase between 1994/1996 and 2000/2001 because those species that were over-represented during the former period reached more equilibrated densities during the latter. The major, indirect implications of these functional. changes are discussed.

Recently, with use of molecular probes and microarray technology, it has been shown that species related to Teleaulax spp. or Chroomonas spp. (clades 4 or 6) contributed the most to cryptophycean biomass in the North Sea. For the microarray study, the single probe (clade 4/6) recognizes members of both clades 4 and 6 and thus cannot separate them. Therefore, it was unknown as to whether the cryptophyte community was composed of clade 4, clade 6 or both of them. Here, we addressed this question and increased the genetic diversity of our investigations of cryptophycean diversity in the North Sea by sequencing 18S rRNA clone libraries made from fractionated water samples to examine specifically the picoplanktonic fraction because that fraction was studied in detail in the earlier microarray study. We focused on samples from the spring phytoplankton bloom in 2004 because the microarray signals were the strongest at this time. Excluding chimeric sequences, we detected nine cryptophycean OTUs, seven of which fell into the Teleaulax/Plagioselmis branch, whereas two grouped with Geminigera spp. Our results indicate that these OTUs, affiliated with clade 4, may be an important component of cryptophyte community during spring bloom in the North Sea.

The area of study extended from 42 degrees N to 48 degrees 30'N, and westwards to 10 degrees W. The depth range of each species was traced in a review of the literature. The number of species in each of several depth zones is summarized here: intertidal, intertidal-30m, 30-100m, and thereafter at 100m depth intervals throughout the entire column (0-5000m). Some 200 species were included (six Scyphozoa, four Staurozoa, 190 Hydrozoa). Of these, 196 could be ascribed to the Coastal Realm (0-200 in) (118 exclusives; 60% of the fauna) and Deep Benthic Realm (200+ in) (31 exclusives; 16%), with 47 species inhabiting both (24%). Eighty-eight species (45%) were present intertidally. Biodiversity was highest above the summer thermocline (30m) (133 species, 67%), and no species have been recorded from depths greater than 4706 in. Beyond the thermocline, biodiversity dropped with increasing depth. A significant change occurred in the 30-100 in interval (123 to 78 species; Distinctiveness= 51 %), although all intervals down to the 300 in isobath exhibited substantial changes. Most species in the Deep Benthic Realm thrive on the upper part of the slope (200-800 in; 50 species). Biodiversity appeared homogeneous across wide bathymetric ranges in deep bathyal and abyssal regions, perhaps due to unique vertical blocenological units. Thus, 15 species are known between 1400 and 2000m, and four between 3100 and 4300m. Fifty-four species were considered eurybathic (34%), with some showing impr. essive bathymetric ranges of over 4000 in, but most species were stenobathic (106, 66%). As with data on benthic medusozoans from South Africa, the north-western Atlantic, the Arctic, and the warm western Atlantic (Bermuda), bathymetric biodiversity was highest in the first 100 in, with a substantial drop below that in species numbers on the shelf and at the beginning of the bathyal. While numbers of species may vary widely from one geographical region to another, such variations are due to differences in biodiversity in the upper 100 in. Hydroid species richness in the deep bathyal and abyssal is similar and always low. Worldwide, benthic medusozoan biodiversity is highest at shallow depths, and thege organisms normally seem to be minor components of deep benthos. Very likely, the graph of biodiversity' at increasing depth is similar worldwide for the Hydrozoa.

A simple 'biodiversity intactness index' (BII) is attractive in using available data and expert opinion, but is seen to be only weakly linked to 'biodiversity' in its usual sense of 'variation'. An example illustrates how an improved BII score could result even when there are large species losses. A family of alternative biodiversity 'representativeness indices' better reflect variation. They use the same readily available information, plus simple species-area relationships (SAR) and genetic diversity curves. A new genetic-diversity abundance-fraction curve, like SAR, is linear in log-log space. The new representativeness indices incorporate, through range-abundance curves, the abundance fraction estimates normally used for BII. Land use or climate change impacts therefore can reflect partial rather than total biodiversity losses at localities. Estimates of biodiversity gains/losses using these indices enable a novel regional planning-based approach for addressing the 2010 target.	Faiths, D. P. ; Ferrier, S. ; Williams, K.

2205	WOS:A1995RH86500003	THE URGENCY OF BUILDING GLOBAL CAPACITY FOR BIODIVERSITY SCIENCE	Biodiversity and Conservation	07/01/1995	NA	16	The biodiversity sciences represent the disciplines of whole-organism biology, including systematics, ecology, population biology, behaviour and the fields of comparative biology. The biodiversity sciences are critically important to society because it is knowledge of whole-organisms that is essential for managing and conserving the world's species. Because of an acceleration in environmental degradation and global biodiversity loss in recent decades, the need for the biodiversity sciences has never been more urgent. Yet, biodiversity science is not well supported relative to other fields of science, and thus the need for knowledge about organisms and their environment is far outstripping biologists' ability to provide it. National and international capacity for biodiversity science must therefore be increased substantially. Each nation should establish a national biodiversity research programme coordinated across all government agencies. An international biodiversity research programme should also be established, perhaps with an organizational structure that parallels the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Biodiversity scientists must assume a leadership role in educating the public and bringing about policy changes that will enhance our understanding of the world's species and their ecosystems.

In order to better understand temporal and spatial variation in late Quaternary biodiversity, foraminiferal faunas of two fossil, raised reef terraces at the southern Sinai Peninsula were studied and compared to modern coral reef faunas. Eleven U-series dates of shell fragments of the giant clam Tridacna sp. indicates deposition largely during marine isotope stage 5 (MIS 5), 77-129 kyr BP, for the two raised terraces. In these terraces, Amphistegina (A. lessonii and A. lobifera) dominates the five fossil foraminiferal associations. The fossil reef-fiat association 1 has common Gypsina piano, Homotrema rubra and Acervulina spp., and fossil reef-fiat association 2 consists of Amphistegina spp. Of the three fossil fore-reef associations, one has abundant porcelaneous taxa including Sorites, Amphisorus, Peneroplis and Borelis, one has a mix of porcelaneous taxa and attached-arborescent taxa (Homotrema and Placopsilina) and one has abundant attached and arborescent taxa (Miniacina, Gypsina, Acervulina and Planogypsina). The modern fringing reef is dominated by porcelaneous foraminifera, and three modern associations are identified. These include a lagoonal association with abundant Peneroplis pertusus, a reef-fiat association dominated by Sorites orbiculus and a fore-reef association with porcelaneous taxa plus common H. rubra, Amphistegina lessonii and A. lobifera. Based on our data and including additional published information on regional biodiversity it appears that during MIS 5 foraminiferal biodiversity was higher and community structure was different than within the modern reefs. These data and regional paleo-climate patterns indicate that oceanographic conditions in the Red Sea were probably closer to normal marine conditions during the last interglacial than they are today.

As such, it is crucial that it is included and fully considered in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This paper explores the definitions and perceptions of biodiversity, and the associated management implications, held by those involved in preparing and assessing EIA documents in Western Australia. This State has world-recognised biodiversity values and comprehensive impact assessment processes. These practitioners defined biodiversity in a range of ways from a very basic through to a sophisticated, extended definition. A range of approaches to its assessment was also evident. The most sophisticated practitioners placed biodiversity in its spatial and temporal context as well as being cognizant of community aspirations and the principle of net conservation benefit. The ability to properly consider biodiversity in EIA is dependent on good information, not only on flora and fauna but also on the concepts and processes associated with biodiversity. Clear policy directions, from the assessing authority, regarding the level and detail of assessment required, are also critical. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We screened 210 films and recorded the duration that each primate species was on screen to evaluate their representation in documentaries and to assess factors potentially driving biases within these depictions. We expected that flagship species would be overrepresented such that: 1) apes would be more frequently included in documentaries than other primate taxa, 2) Critically Endangered and Endangered species would be more frequently included in documentaries than those of less concern, and 3) large-bodied primates would have more on-screen time than smaller-bodied primates. Due to factors affecting the accessibility of species, we hypothesized that: 4) species of Least Concern would be overrepresented, and 5) diurnal and cathemeral primates would be overrepresented compared to nocturnal primates. We found that documentary films portray only a fraction of primate biodiversity. Only a third of primate specie are portrayed in documentaries, and these tend to be large flagship species and easily filmed species. African apes were overrepresented compared to other primate taxa. Endangered and Least Concern species were overrepresented, whereas Vulnerable and Near Threatened species were underrepresented. Larger-bodied species and non-nocturnal primates were featured in more films and had longer on-screen times than smaller or nocturnal primates. Our findings suggest that audiences may benefit from the collaboration of filmmakers and scientists, which would likely result in greater species representation and more comprehensive coverage of relevant conservation issues.

This paper explores the macroalgal diversity of a large system of artificial reefs in Loch Linnhe, on the west coast of Scotland, in a quantitative and qualitative study based on diving surveys and correlates the observations with the prevalent abiotic factors. The study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that artificial reefs can enhance seaweed habitats-in particular, for kelps-and that there is a clear correlation with substrate type. While the reef is home to a large range of biota and abundance of early-successional species of turf and bushy macroalgae, totalling 56 taxa and with Delesseria sanguinea as the dominant species, canopy-forming perennial kelp species are conspicuously relatively rare. Macroalgal vegetation is explored in correlation with reef geometry/geography and depth. Statistical analysis shows benthic communities were strongly affected by substrate type, with turf algae and invertebrates dominating the artificial reefs, while bushy algae dominate the natural ones. Common macroinvertebrates associated with the phytobenthic communities are assessed qualitatively.	Tsiamis, Konstantinos ; Salomidi, Maria ; Gerakaris, Vasilis ; Mogg, Andrew O.

Implementation of such programs is impeded by a general decrease in the number of skilled naturalists. Here we studied how morphotypes, instead of species, might be used by unskilled participants (referred to as \""volunteers\"") to survey common plant communities. Our main questions were: (1) Can morphotypes be used as a robust estimator of species-richness (alpha-diversity) and assemblage turnover (beta-diversity)? and (2) What is the robustness (reproducibility and repeatability) of such methods? Double inventories were performed on 150 plots in arable field margins, one by a non-expert using morphotypes, the other by a taxonomist using species. To test the robustness of morphotype identification among participants, 20 additional plots were surveyed by eight volunteers using the same protocol. We showed that (1) the number of morphotypes identified by unskilled volunteers in a plot was always strongly correlated with species-richness. (2) Morphotypes were sensitive to differences among habitats but were less accurate than species to detect these differences. (3) Morphotype identification varied significantly within and between volunteers. Due to this lack of repeatability and reproducibility, parataxonomy cannot be considered a good surrogate for taxonomy. Nevertheless, assuming that morphotypes are identified with standardized methods, and that results are used only to evaluate gross species-richness but not species turnover, parataxonomy might be a valuable tool for rapid biodiversity assessment of common wild flora."

To this purpose, we formulated an optimization model aimed to support decisions behind the planning of agricultural ecosystems. We demonstrate the proposed approach onto the design agroecosystems aimed at the regeneration of deforested lands in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate how the different objectives influence the species composition and the overall sustainability performance. The model incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability into the optimization objectives, i.e., annual income (economic dimension), species diversity (environmental dimension), and income stability (social dimension). The obtained results show, firstly, relevant tradeoffs between the economic objective and the social and ecological ones, with significant reductions in short term incomes in the agroecosystems with the highest levels of diversity. Secondly, the species compositions changes over time depending on the life cycle of selected species and following ecological succession paths. Finally, species diversity also determines heterogeneous ecological structures, and these are jointly good premises for ecosystem multi-functionality. We highlighted major methodological challenges for the planning of more sustainable agroecosystems, which are mainly linked to the conflict and trade-off analysis, long-term assessment, non steady-state solutions, and lack of data. Despite these challenges, the formulated optimization framework can quantitatively support the understanding and the pursuing of both the ecological conservation and the productivity of agroecosystems, and put the basis for future more detailed models.

This particular riparian forest has been studied extensively by a group of ecologists belonging to the CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research) in Toulouse. A contingent valuation method was applied. A representative sample of 402 persons living in the surrounding region (the 'departements' Tarn-et-Garonne and Haute-Garonne) was asked in face-to-face interviews about their willingness-to-pay for the restoration programme. Even if these persons are familiar with the good to value because they live close to the river bank (less than 30 km), it appears that they adopt a donation attitude more than a transaction attitude. Moreover, an open question seems preferable to a close-ended question, in contrast to the recommendations made by the American administration.

To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5 km x 5 km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Woodland conservation has long been based on site protection, but recent changes in policy, attitude and practice have opened up the possibility of recreating native forest cover on a much larger scale. The ECONET approach appears to have much to offer as the basis for enhancing the biodiversity of Scotland's forest resource. A network could be developed from existing woods to form a Scotland-wide network of Core Forest Areas and major landscape links, largely associated with major valleys. To achieve this, existing concentrations of woodland would be extended into poorly wooded districts. Many vulnerable wildlife species are likely to benefit, and there would be other benefits for recreation, landscape and timber production.

The acquisition of data on assemblage structure over a variety of spatial scales is important to understand the variation of biodiversity patterns. During the ANT XXIX/3 (PS81) expedition of RV Polarstern, three different regions at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula were sampled: the northwestern Weddell Sea, the Bransfield Strait, and the northern boundary of the South Shetland Archipelago in the Drake Passage. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution and biodiversity patterns of ophiuroid assemblages in these regions and depths. We quantified different community parameters in terms of the number of species, abundance, and biomass. Additionally, we calculated various components of species diversity (alpha, beta, and gamma diversity) over the three regions. Based on the benthic surveys, we collected 3331 individuals that were identified to species level (17 species). Overall, species diversity, as measured based on rarefaction, species richness and evenness estimators, was higher in the Bransfield Strait compared to the Weddell Sea and Drake Passage. Two deep stations in the Weddell Sea showed high dominance only of Ophionotus victoriae. Significant differences in the patterns of alpha diversity were found among the regions but not between depth zones, whereas beta diversity showed no differences. Regarding the resemblance among the ophiuroid assemblages of each region, there was a significant gradient from east to west with a maximum distance between the stations in the Drake Passage and the Weddell Sea. This study provides a baseline for detecting potential effects related to climate change, and it furnishes a basis for the implementation of monitoring schemes of Antarctic assemblages.

Under these approaches particular species or groups of species are used as proxies for other biota, particular environmental conditions, or for environmental change. The indicator species approach contrasts with a direct measurement approach in which the focus is on a single entity or a highly targeted subset of entities in a given ecosystem but no surrogacy relationships with unmeasured entities are assumed. Here, we present a broad philosophical discussion of the indicator species and direct measurement approaches because their relative advantages and disadvantages are not well understood by many researchers, resource managers and policy makers. A goal of the direct measurement approach is to demonstrate a causal relationship between key attributes of the target ecosystem system (for example, particular environmental conditions) and the entities selected for measurement. The key steps in the approach are based on the fundamental scientific principles of hypothesis testing and associated direct measurement that drive research activities, management activities and monitoring programs. The direct measurement approach is based on four critical assumptions:(1) the 'right' entities to measure have been selected, (2) these entities are well known, (3) there is sufficient understanding about key ecological processes and (4) the entities selected can be accurately measured. The direct measurement approach is reductionist and many elements of the biota, many biotic processes and environmental factors must be ignored because of practical considerations. The steps in applying the indicator species approach are broadly similar to the direct measurement approach, except surrogacy relationships also must be quantified between a supposed indicator species or indicator group and the factors for which it is purported to be a proxy. Such quantification needs to occur via: (1) determining the taxonomic, spatial and temporal bounds for which a surrogacy relationship does and does not hold. That is, the extent of transferability of a given surrogate such as an indicator species to other biotic groups, to landscapes, ecosystems, environmental circumstances or over time in the same location can be determined; and (2) determining the ecological mechanisms underpinning a surrogacy relationship (for example, through fundamental studies of community structure). Very few studies have rigorously addressed these two tasks, despite the extremely widespread use of the indicator species approach and similar kinds of surrogate schemes in virtually all fields of environmental, resource and conservation management. We argue that this has the potential to create significant problems; thus, the use of an indicator species approach needs to be better justified. Attempts to quantify surrogacy relationships may reveal that, in some circumstances, the alternative of direct measurement of particular entities of environmental or conservation interest will be the best option.

However, they can also help to predict species' fates and so can be useful tools for managing the future of biodiversity. This article starts by sketching how phylogenetic, geographic, and trait information can be combined to elucidate present mammalian diversity patterns and how they arose. Recent diversification rates and standing diversity show different geographic patterns, indicating that cradles of diversity have moved over time. Patterns in extinction risk reflect both biological differences among mammalian lineages and differences in threat intensity among regions. Phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that for small-bodied mammals, extinction risk is governed mostly by where the species live and the intensity of the threats, whereas for large-bodied mammals, ecological differences also play an important role. This modeling approach identifies species whose intrinsic biology renders them particularly vulnerable to increased human pressure. We outline how the approach might be extended to consider future trends in anthropogenic drivers, to identify likely future battlegrounds of mammalian conservation, and the likely casualties. This framework could help to highlight consequences of choosing among different future climatic and socioeconomic scenarios. We end by discussing priority-setting, showing how alternative currencies for diversity can suggest very different priorities. We argue that aiming to maximize long-term evolutionary responses is inappropriate, that conservation planning needs to consider costs as well as benefits, and that proactive conservation of largely intact systems should be part of a balanced strategy.

Their dependence on plants for carbon, however, means that any changes in plant community structure or function caused by rising atmospheric CO2 or loss of plant species diversity could affect earthworm activity, which may feed back on plant communities. Production of surface casts measured during three consecutive years in field experimental plots (n = 24, 1.2 m(2)) planted with local calcareous grassland species that varied in plant species richness (diversity levels: high, 31 species; medium, 12; low, 5) and were exposed to ambient (356 mu l CO2 l(-1)) or elevated (600 mu l CO2 l(-1)) CO2 was only consistently stimulated in high diversity plots exposed to elevated CO2 (+120 %, 31 spp: 603 +/- A 52 under ambient CO2 vs. 1,325 +/- A 204 g cast dwt. m(-2) year(-1) under elevated CO2 in 1996; +77 %, 940 +/- A 44 vs. 1,663 +/- A 204 g cast dwt. m(-2) year(-1) in 1998). Reductions in plant diversity had little effect on cast production in ecosystems maintained at ambient CO2, but the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on cast production disappeared when plant species diversity was decreased to 12 and 5 species. High diversity plots were also the only communities that included plant species that an earlier field study showed to be among the most responsive to elevated CO2 and to be most preferred by earthworms to deposit casts near. Further, the +87 % CO2-induced increase in cast production measured over the 3 years corresponded to a parallel increase in cumulative total nitrogen of 5.7 g N m(-2) and would help explain the large stimulation of aboveground plant biomass production observed in high-diversity communities under elevated CO2. The results of this study demonstrate how the loss of plant species from communities can alter responses of major soil heterotrophs and consequently ecosystem biogeochemistry.

Here we combine species distribution models of a near-complete set of species of reptiles and amphibians known from the island with body size data and a tabulation of herpetofaunal communities from field surveys, compiled up to 2008. Though taxonomic revisions and novel distributional records arose since compilation, we are confident that the data are appropriate for inferring and comparing biogeographic patterns among these groups of organisms. We observed species richness of both amphibians and reptiles was highest in the humid rainforest biome of eastern Madagascar, but reptiles also show areas of high richness in the dry and subarid western biomes. In several amphibian subclades, especially within the Mantellidae, species richness peaks in the central eastern geographic regions while in reptiles different subclades differ distinctly in their richness centers. A high proportion of clades and subclades of both amphibians and reptiles have a peak of local endemism in the topo-graphically and bioclimatically diverse northern geographic regions. This northern area is roughly delimited by a diagonal spanning from 15.5 degrees S on the east coast to ca. 15.0 degrees S on the west coast. Amphibian diversity is highest at altitudes between 800-1200m above sea-level whereas reptiles have their highest richness at low elevations, probably reflecting the comparatively large number of species specialized to the extended low-elevation areas in the dry and subarid biomes. We found that the range sizes of both amphibians and reptiles strongly correlated with body size, and differences between the two groups are explained by the larger body sizes of reptiles. However, snakes have larger range sizes than lizards which cannot be readily explained by their larger body sizes alone. Range filling, i.e., the amount of suitable habitat occupied by a species, is less expressed in amphibians than in reptiles, possibly reflecting their lower dispersal capacity. Taxonomic composition of communities assessed by field surveys is largely explained by bioclimatic regions, with communities from the dry and especially subarid biomes distinctly differing from humid and subhumid biomes.

Occur throughout the Barr and Ardmillan groups (middle Llanvirn-upper Ashgill) in the Girvan district of SW Scotland. A dataset of 350 brachiopod species front 30 horizons through the Middle-Upper Ordovician Succession forms the basis for a description of brachiopod diversity through the succession and comparison with global patterns and trends through this time interval. The Middle Ordovician Barr Group incorporates shallow water carbonate and clastic facies, characterised by Valcourea confinis, with deeper-water facies. The trilobite-dominated Albany Group preserves outer shelf biofacies. Deep-water facies occur in the Balclatchie Formation of the lower Ardmillan Group, including an early Occurrence of a Foliomena-type species. High diversity brachiopod faunas Occur in elastic facies, though man), of the biofacies have a transported component to them. Representatives of the deep-water Foliomena fauna occur intermittently throughout the Upper Ardmillan Group, appearing in both the Whitehouse and Drummuck subgroups. This distinctive assemblage of small, thin-shelled brachiopods, including Dedzetina. Christiania, Cyclospira and Foliomena itself, is interbedded with a variety of other less cosmopolitan deep-water assemblages, including the Onniella-Skenidioides and Lingulella-Trimurellina associations. Shallower-water environments in the middle Ashgill Lower Drummuck Subgroup hosted the Fardenia-Eopholidostrophia association in sands, and the Christiania-Leptaena association in muds and silts. The remarkable Lady Burn Starfish Beds in the upper part of the group contain a variety of brachiopod-dominated assemblages, including the Eochonetes and Plaesiomys-Schizophorella associations, transported from various shelf locations, within a very diverse mid Ashgill biota. The upper Ashgill High Mains Formation contains abundant elements of the terminal Ordovician Hirnantia fauna, including Eostropheodonta. Hindella and Hirnantia itself, but also some taxa more typical of the Laurentian Edgewood Province. As a whole, the changing brachiopod biodiversity biofacies reflect environmental fluctuations, on this part of the Laurentian margin. driven by mainly eustatic and tectonic events against a background of global biotic radiation.

Here we demonstrate an approach to plan protected areas that address the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm. Specifically, we provide an example of an approach to planning protected areas that integrates pelagic and benthic conservation in the southern Benguela and Agulhas Bank ecosystems off South Africa. Our aim was to represent species of importance to fisheries and species of conservation concern within protected areas. In addition to representation, we ensured that protected areas were designed to consider pelagic dynamics, characterized from time-series data on key oceanographic processes, together with data on the abundance of small pelagic fishes. We found that, to have the highest likelihood of reaching conservation targets, protected area selection should be based on time-specific data rather than data averaged across time. More generally, we argue that innovative methods are needed to conserve ephemeral and dynamic pelagic biodiversity.

We assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of a northern network of 1,749 protected areas spread over > 600,000 km(2) in Quebec, Canada. Using ecological niche modeling, we calculated potential changes in the probability of occurrence of 529 species to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on (1) species gain, loss, turnover, and richness in protected areas, (2) representativity of protected areas, and (3) extent of species ranges located in protected areas. We predict a major species turnover over time, with 49% of total protected land area potentially experiencing a species turnover > 80%. We also predict increases in regional species richness, representativity of protected areas, and species protection provided by protected areas. Although we did not model the likelihood of species colonising habitats that become suitable as a result of climate change, northern protected areas should ultimately become important refuges for species tracking climate northward. This is the first study to examine in such details the potential effects of climate change on a northern protected area network.

We test the relationship between fuelwood consumption and per capita income for 270 households distributed over 7 rural settlements. In general 76% of the households use fuelwood regularly and consume on average 686 kg/person/year of tree biomass, poorer people, however, consume 961 kg/person/year. Harvesting is concentrated to a few early successional species. Yet, annual rural population demand from 210 municipalities may reach 303,793 tons, equivalent to 1.2 to 2.1 thousand hectares of tropical forest. Fuelwood harvesting cannot be ignored as a major and chronic source of forest degradation in highly fragmented and densely populated landscapes and conciliating biodiversity conservation with poverty amelioration is an urgent task.

They can have different ecological functions: habitats for plant species, conduits, filters, sources and sinks. They can contain sparse, intermittent vegetation cover, and are frequently free of vegetation except along the banks and levees. We hypothesised that this disturbed and fragmented landscape unit encourages biodiversity with characteristic plant species adapted to survive in the channel niches. In this study, which was carried out mostly in the subalpine belt of the Adamello-Presanella Group, we aimed to characterize floristic and biodiversity patterns with respect to the dominant channel gradients by means of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination approach and an analysis of diversity indexes. The frequency table and CCA results showed considerable floristic heterogeneity within the composite channels mainly as a function of nutrient availability and altitude. Different gradients of biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma diversity) depended on the geomorphological disturbances (alpha and gamma) and environmental heterogeneity across the channel subunits. Geomorphological processes seem to play key roles in the dispersal of seeds, spores and propagules and in the colonization, establishment and spread of plants in this complex environment. The composite channels could play an important refuge-habitat function for microthermic species during the widely accepted current trend of global warming. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Islands are particularly vulnerable to invasive species, especially Mediterranean islands which have suffered human pressure since ancient times. In the Balearic archipelago, reptiles represent an outstanding case with more alien than native species. Moreover, in the last decade a new wave of alien snakes landed in the main islands of the archipelago, some of which were originally snake-free. The identification of the origin and colonization pathways of alien species, as well as the prediction of their expansion, is crucial to develop effective conservation strategies. In this study, we used molecular markers to assess the allochthonous status and the putative origin of the four introduced snake species (Hemorrhois hippocrepis, Malpolon monspessulanus, Macroprotodon mauritanicus and Rhinechis scalaris) as well as ecological niche models to infer their patterns of invasion and expansion based on current and future habitat suitability. For most species, DNA sequence data suggested the Iberian Peninsula as the potential origin of the allochthonous populations, although the shallow phylogeographic structure of these species prevented the identification of a restricted source-area. For all of them, the ecological niche models showed a current low habitat suitability in the Balearic, which is however predicted to increase significantly in the next few decades under climate change scenarios. Evidence from direct observations and spatial distribution of the first-occurrence records of alien snakes (but also lizards and worm lizards) suggest the nursery trade, and in particular olive tree importation from Iberian Peninsula, as the main pathway of introduction of alien reptiles in the Balearic islands. This trend has been reported also for recent invasions in NE Spain, thus showing that olive trees transplantation may be an effective vector for bioinvasion across the Mediterranean. The combination of molecular and ecological tools used in this study reveals a promising approach for the understanding of the complex invasion process, hence guiding conservation management actions.

While prior research has focused on species migrations per se, ecotones may respond to different environmental factors than species. Even if species can migrate in response to climate change, if ecotones do not they can function as hard barriers to species migrations, making ecotone migrations central to understanding species persistence under scenarios of climate change. We examined a 42-year span of aerial photographs and high resolution satellite imagery to calculate migration rates of timberline-the grassland-forest ecotone-inside and outside of protected areas in the high Peruvian Andes. We found that timberline in protected areas was more likely to migrate upward in elevation than in areas with frequent cattle grazing and fire. However, rates in both protected (0.24 m yr(-1)) and unprotected (0.05 m yr(-1)) areas are only 0.5-2.3% of the rates needed to stay in equilibrium with projected climate by 2100. These ecotone migration rates are 12.5 to 110 times slower than the observed species migration rates within the same forest, suggesting a barrier to migration for mid-and high-elevation species. We anticipate that the ecotone will be a hard barrier to migration under future climate change, leading to drastic population and biodiversity losses in the region unless intensive management steps are taken.

Without appropriate computational tools, the process of determining these national responsibilities and conservation priorities is time intensive when considering many species across geographic scales. Here, we have developed a computational tool as a module for the ArcGIS geographic information system. The ArcGIS National Responsibility Assessment Tool (NRA-Tool) can be used to create hierarchical lists of national responsibilities and priorities for global species conservation. Our tool will allow conservationists to prioritize conservation efforts and to focus limited resources on relevant species and regions. We showcase our tool with data on 258 bird species and various biophysical regions, including Environmental Zones in 58 Asian countries and regions. Our tool provides a decision support system for conservation policy with attractive and easily interpretable visual outputs illustrating national responsibilities and priorities for species conservation. The graphical output allows for smooth integration into assessment reports, such as the European Article 17 report, the Living Planet Index report, or similar regional and global reports.

Our goals were to establish the form of the relation between diversity and productivity (measured as seafloor particulate organic carbon or POC flux), and to verify the positive and negative effect of sediment particle size diversity (SED) and the seasonality in POC flux (SVI), respectively, on diversity, as observed for other oceanographic regions and taxa. In addition, we hypothesised that higher taxon diversity is associated with higher functional diversity, which in turn stimulates nematode carbon mineralisation rates (determined from biomass-dependent respiration estimates). Taxon diversity related positively to seafloor POC flux. Phylogenetic diversity (measured as average taxonomic distinctness) was affected negatively by the magnitude and variability in POC flux, and positively by SED. The latter also showed an inverse relation with trophic diversity. Accounting for differences in total biomass between samples, we observed a positive linear relation between taxon diversity and carbon mineralisation in nematode communities. We could, however, not identify the potential mechanism through which taxon diversity may promote this ecosystem function since none of the functional diversity indices related to both diversity and nematode respiration. The present results suggest potential effects of climate change on deep-sea ecosystem functioning, but further also emphasise the need for a better understanding of nematode functions and their response to evolutionary processes.

Additionally, it is also one of the most important sources of livelihood for different kinds of stakeholders at various levels of resource markets-local, domestic, or international. With globalization and increasing sophistication in the methods of commercial trade in biological resources, various issues arise related to the sustenance of resources, of ecological balances, and equity in transactions. All of these are concerns to be addressed to achieve a state of 'sustainability.' This paper prescribes to the definition of 'sustainability' as the capacity to maintain a certain process or state for ""improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems'' (IUCN/UNEP/WWF, in Caring for the Earth: a strategy for sustainable living. Gland, Switzerland, 1991). This goes beyond ensuring inter- and intragenerational equity in access to resources and includes several other parameters, including equity among stakeholders to returns from biological resources, related knowledge, trade-offs, and ethical business practices related to these resources. Through the prism of an examination of a simplistic supply route(s) and value addition chain of biodiversity resources for commercial use, this paper reviews and highlights issues related to 'sustainability' at each stage. Evidence points to shortcomings in the sustainable use of biological resources at each stage of value addition, calling for focused and specific measures to address them."	Suneetha, M.

Being a synthetic discipline, it is primarily 'fed' by the established fields of biological sciences, such as taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, evolution, genetics, and the like. Taxonomy, which essentially deals with discovery, description and classification of living organisms, underpins the basic understanding of biodiversity on Earth. The vast knowledge base generated through the theory and practice of taxonomy endows scientists in particular and the public in general with a precious password key, for free, which unlocks gates to unravel, understand and utilise the hidden treasure trove of biodiversity on the globe. Recognising this, the present paper attempts to highlight the inherent interface between the fields of taxonomy (already existing) and biodiversity science (recently emerging). We first explore the various indispensable roles of taxonomy in accomplishing challengeable goals of the documentation, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The paper then highlights the current problems that need to be surmounted urgently, and finally sketches the future challenges to be met upfront, for a more productive interface between taxonomy and biodiversity sciences.

Market-based approaches can incentivize conservation behaviors on private lands by shifting the benefit-cost ratio of engaging in activities that result in net conservation benefits for target species. In the United States and elsewhere, voluntary conservation agreements with financial incentives are becoming an increasingly common strategy. While the influence of program design and delivery of voluntary conservation programs is often overlooked, these aspects are critical to achieving the necessary participation to attain landscape-scale outcomes. Using a sample of family-forest landowners in the southeast United States, we show how preferences for participation in a conservation program to protect an at-risk species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), are related to program structure, delivery, and perceived efficacy. Landowners were most sensitive to programs that are highly controlling, require permanent conservation easements, and put landowners at risk for future regulation. Programs designed with greater levels of compensation and that support landowners' autonomy to make land management decisions can increase participation and increase landowner acceptance of program components that are generally unfavorable, like long-term contracts and permanent easements. There is an inherent trade-off between maximizing participation and maximizing the conservation benefits when designing a conservation incentive program. For conservation programs targeting private lands to achieve landscape-level benefits, they must attract a critical level of participation that creates a connected mosaic of conservation benefits. Yet, programs with attributes that strive to maximize conservation benefits within a single agreement (and reduce risks of failure) are likely to have lower participation, and thus lower landscape benefits. Achieving levels of landowner participation in conservation agreement programs that deliver lasting, landscape-level benefits requires careful attention not only to how the program structure influences potential conservation benefits, but also how it influences landowners and their potential to participate.

We review recent evidence for the impacts of decentralization on the biodiversity values of forests and forested landscapes, which encompass most of the biodiversity of the tropics. Few studies document the impact of decentralized management on biodiversity. We conclude that there may be situations where local management is a good option for biodiversity but there are also situations where this is not the case. We advocate increased research to document the impact of local management on biodiversity. We also argue that locally managed forests should be seen as components of landscapes where governance arrangements favor the achievement of a balance between the local livelihood values and the global public goods values of forests.

Many prioritisation methods have been suggested at different spatial scales, including those based cn single-taxon criteria. One such scheme is BirdLife International's system of important bird areas (IBAs). Whilst IBA site qualification criteria are entirely bird-based, the intention is that these sites should conserve wider biodiversity. This idea has yet to be tested quantitatively, but a unique opportunity to do so exists in Uganda. where the Forest Department (FD) has conducted comprehensive inventories of five taxa. (birds, butterflies, large moths, small mammals and woody plants) in 50 Ugandan Forest Reserves. Independently, Nature Uganda (the national conservation NGO) identified 30 IBAs, 13 of which were also forest reserves. In this paper we used the FD dataset to evaluate the efficiency with which Uganda's forest IBAs capture species richness in other groups. In a combined area of 5445 km 2, Uganda's 13 forest IBAs contained as many species as did an equal-sized set of sites selected by applying a complementarity-based algorithm to all FD data. Modifying this simple greedy algorithm to take account of site area resulted in a priority set that outperformed IBAs, but that consisted of far more sites for similar species representation. Our results illustrate the utility of the IBA network for representing a wide range of biodiversity. A major benefit of IBAs is the low cost of obtaining bird data relative to comprehensive multi-taxon inventories. The general applicability of these results outside tropical forests requires further investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared the physicochemical and aquatic biodiversity characteristics of ditches, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams in five locations in Europe in three biogeographic zones. At the individual site level (alpha diversity), rivers were found to be the most species-rich waterbodies; however, at the regional level (gamma diversity), ponds were the most species-rich aquatic habitat for both wetland plants and macroinvertebrates. In terms of rare species, ponds also had a higher rarity value, measured by a Species Rarity Index, than other habitat types, although data for this analysis were only available from the United Kingdom. The high biodiversity values of ponds suggest that they should be more central to strategies for the protection and management of aquatic biodiversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relationships between traditional grazing and farming activities and biodiversity were analysed by comparing species richness and temporal turnover across three different habitat types, defined according to vegetation structure and human land use. In this study, both spatial (landscape, among-habitats) and temporal (intra-annual, seasonal) analyses were contemplated at mesoscale. The measurement and use of temporal beta diversity (i.e. an index of temporal species turnover) in conservation biology showed that it is a simple method to characterize and compare different habitat species-assemblages, particularly when time seems to be a significant factor in explaining biodiversity features. Our results showed open mosaic areas as the richest and most temporally heterogeneous habitats. We suggest the maintenance of traditional human activities carried out in these areas, since they have been a significant diversification agent, to avoid the loss of the high Mediterranean biological diversity.

In view of this fact, the present study aims to understand the similarities in plant species distribution and their ethnobotanical uses in the Indian Himalayas and the Slovenian Alps. The plant species common in both the mountain systems and used by local inhabitants were compiled by extensive literature search and also by carrying out primary surveys. Ethnobotanical information was collected through personal interviews of villagers with the help of local assistants and also through direct and indirect observations made during the field surveys. A total of 59 ethnobotanical species representing 17 families common in both the Indian Himalayas and the Slovenian Alps were documented, of these 78% obtained medicinal properties and traditionally used by local people for curing diseases. Comparatively, people of the Indian Himalayas used plants for medicine in higher percentage (73%) than the people of Slovenia (42%). Of the total medicinal plants, only 7 plant species such as Acorus calamus, Capsella bursa-partoris, Hypericum perforatum, Origanum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris, Solanum nigrum and Urtica dioica had some common uses in both the Slovenian Alps and the Indian Himalayas. In the Slovenian Alps, the maximum ethnobotanical species (61%) had wide distribution range whereas maximum ethnobotanical species in the Indian Himalayas (62%) had localized distribution. Though, 27% of common ethnobotanical species belonged to different threat categories, only 2 species-Taxus baccata and Hippophae rhamnoides-are placed under similar threat category in these two different mountain areas. The study unfolds relationship in plant species distribution and their ethnobotanical uses along with offering an opportunity to provide information on uses of plant species though available but unknown to community.

4097	WOS:000165813400005	Conservation strategy of a nature reserve in Mediterranean ecosystems: the effects of protection from grazing on biodiversity	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/12/2000	NA	100	Protection of natural areas has caused the elimination of traditional grazing activity on many occasions. As a result, in Mediterranean ecosystems a loss of biodiversity is usually related to a decrease of grassland and grassland-bush mosaic areas. In order to establish relationships between land use and the relative importance of each type of habitat in terms of species richness and endemicity, the Font Roja Natural Park in Alicante Province (SE Iberian Peninsula) was studied. Four sites were selected representing the four different existing habitats: a wooded area (holm-oak forest), a dense shrubland, a dense grassland, and a grassland-shrubland mosaic area. In each site, the species composition of vegetation and dung beetle fauna were analysed. The results showed that the highest diversity and endemicity, for plants and beetles, were concentrated in the dense grasslands and the grassland-shrubland mosaic. Thus, controlled grazing activity of sheep and goats which maintained a diverse variegated landscape would favour the historical sustenance of the biodiversity of Mediterranean ecosystems, as that would allow a remarkable diversity of habitats with higher conservation levels of existing species richness and endemicity. Therefore, we propose a reintroduction of traditional grazing of sheep and goats throughout ecological, cultural and economical measures, which would include guidelines and regulations, set out to boost an integrated rural policy.

Culturable airborne fungi were sampled using a slit-to-agar impactor (Chirana aeroscope). High levels of contamination were recorded, with more than 700 colony-forming units per cubic metre of air in 85% of the buildings sampled, and more than 1,000 in 55% of buildings. Of the 28 genera and 31 species identified, the most common were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium citrinum, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium sphaerospermum. Genus and species diversity was analysed, and new findings were obtained regarding Cuba's atmospheric ecosystem.

4777	WOS:000393643700013	17 years of grassland management leads to parallel local and regional biodiversity shifts among a wide range of taxonomic groups	Biodiversity and Conservation	01/03/2017	10.1007/s10531-016-1269-5	7	Conservation management is expected to increase local biodiversity, but uniform management may lead to biotic homogenization and diversity losses at the regional scale. We evaluated the effects of renewed grazing and cutting management carried out across a whole region, on the diversity of plants and seven arthropod groups. Changes in occurrence over 17 years of intensive calcareous grassland management were analysed at the species level, which gave insight into the exact species contributing to regional homogenization or differentiation. Reponses were compared between species differing in habitat affinity, dispersal ability, food specialisation and trophic level. Local species richness increased over the sampling period for true bugs and millipedes, while carabid beetles and weevils declined in local species richness. Species richness remained unchanged for plants, woodlice, ants and spiders. Regional diversity and compositional variation generally followed local patterns. Diversity shifts were only to a limited extent explained by species' habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic level and food specialisation. We conclude that implementation of relatively uniform conservation management across a region did not lead to uniform changes in local species composition. This is an encouraging result for conservation managers, as it shows that there is not necessarily a conflict of interest between local and regional conservation goals. Our study also demonstrates that shifts in diversity patterns differ markedly between taxonomic groups. Single traits provide only limited understanding of these differences. This highlights the need for a wide taxonomic scope when evaluating conservation management and demonstrates the need to understand the mechanisms underlying occurrence shifts.	van Noordwijk, C. G.

The 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' suggests that disturbance regimes generate predictable non-linear patterns in species richness. Evidence often contradicts intermediate disturbance hypothesis at small scales, and is generally lacking at large regional scales. Here, we present the largest extent study of human impacts on boreal plant biodiversity to date. Disturbance extent ranged from 0 to 100% disturbed in vascular plant communities, varying from intact forest to agricultural fields, forestry cut blocks and oil sands. We show for the first time that across a broad region species richness peaked in communities with intermediate anthropogenic disturbance, as predicted by intermediate disturbance hypothesis, even when accounting for many environmental covariates. Intermediate disturbance hypothesis was consistently supported across trees, shrubs, forbs and grasses, with temporary and perpetual disturbances. However, only native species fit this pattern; exotic species richness increased linearly with disturbance.	Mayor, S. J. ; Cahill, J.

The fisheries and conservation benefits of alternative reserve designs would ideally be assessed using dynamic models, which consider spillover of fish and larvae to fished areas, and the displacement of fishers to unprotected sites. In practice, however, decisions about the location of marine reserves generally rely on cheaper and faster static models. Static models analyze only spatial patterns in habitats, and typically assume fisheries profits are reduced by the amount that was generated in areas designated as reserves. To help determine the benefits of developing dynamic fisheries models, we assessed how well static models estimate costs of reserve systems to fisheries and how outcomes from reserves designed using either static or dynamic models differ. We tested these questions in two case studies, the network of marine protected areas in southern California, USA and the proposed Tun Mustapha Marine Park in Malaysia. Static models could either under or over-estimate the cost of reserve plans to fisheries, depending on the relative importance of fisher movement and larval dispersal dynamics. Despite the inaccuracy of static models for estimating costs, reserves designed using static models were similar to those designed with dynamic models if fisheries were well managed; or larval dispersal networks were simple. If larval networks were complex or there was overfishing, dynamic models generated substantially different reserve networks from static models, which improved conservation outcomes by up to 10% and fishing profits by up 20%. The time-scale of management was also important, because only dynamic models accounted for larval dispersal, so could find reserves that maximized the long-term benefits of larval spillover. Our case studies provide quantitative support for the assertion that static models can be useful for planning marine reserves for short-term objectives in well managed fisheries, but are not reliable for evaluating the relative costs of reserves to fisheries.

In forestry, the consideration of some stand features such as requiring a certain volume of deadwood and/or large trees as a part of the management regime may help to preserve and enhance biodiversity. However, it is likely to lead to a decrease in the benefits obtained from timber sales. This chapter presents a bioeconomic model that allows the optimal selective logging regime of a size-distributed forest to be determined, while taking climate change and biodiversity into account. It analyzes to what extent structural targets related to biodiversity affect the optimal forest management regime and the profitability of forests. For this purpose, an empirical analysis under various climate change scenarios is conducted for two diameter-distributed stands of Pinus sylvestris in Catalonia. The results show that the costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of reduced profitability can be significant, and augment with climate change.

On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM. Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p < 0.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment.

7590	WOS:000310999000019	Traits, trees and taxa: global dimensions of biodiversity in mammals	Proceedings of the Royal Society b-Biological Sciences	22/12/2012	10.1098/rspb.2012.1981	38	Measures of biodiversity encompass variation along several dimensions such as species richness (SR), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional/trait diversity (TD). At the global scale, it is widely recognized that SR and PD are strongly correlated, but the extent to which either tends to capture variation in TD is unclear. Here, we assess relationships among PD, SR and TD for a number of traits both across clades and regional assemblages of mammals. We also contrast results using two different measures of TD, trait variance and a new measure we refer to as trait bin filling (the number of orders of magnitude of variation that contain at least one species). When TD is defined as trait variance, PD is a much stronger correlate of TD than SR across clades, consistent with hypotheses about the conservation value of PD. However, when TD is defined as bin filling, PD and SR show similar correlations with TD across clades and space. We also investigate potential losses of SR, PD and TD if species that are currently threatened were to go extinct, and find that threatened PD is often a similar predictor of threatened TD as SR.

This study was intended to investigate the changes in grassland community in response to protection and forest tree plantation practice as well as to explore the underlying environmental gradients responsible for the observed differences or similarities among these vegetation types. Two multivariate analysis methods including discriminate analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling were used to quantify changes in community composition and attributes following different management practices (free grazing, protection with open grassland, sparse and dense forest tree plantations). This was investigated using species frequency, species abundance, or habitat characteristics. The study results showed that habitat types differed significantly between each other and were significantly separated using multivariate approaches. Discrimination based on habitat characteristics and species composition indicated that protection (or grazing) and light (or shade) explained more than 90% of the observed variability in community changes in response to the protection and forest tree plantation. Also, results indicated that shade effect can be attributed to tree canopy cover and/or litter accumulation on the ground. It could be hypothesized that protection from grazing and afforestation resulted in complex environmental gradients of which shade, litter accumulation as well as protection from grazing disturbance are major constituents. A careful manipulation of protection and afforestation can be used to create a spatially different environmental gradients leading to greater habitat diversity as well as a greater species diversity, and better conservation means of grassland in semi-arid areas.

Plant species biodiversity and evenness were greatest in lightly- and moderately-grazed pastures. Both pastures were dominated by the warm-season shortgrass Bouteloua gracilis, but the cool-season midgrasses Pascopyrum smithii and Stipa comata contributed significantly to biomass production on the lightly-grazed pasture, as they did in the exclosures. Diversity was least in the exclosures, which were strongly dominated by the cactus Opuntia polyacantha. Buchloe dactyloides, another warm-season shortgrass, and Bouteloua gracilis were co-dominants under heavy grazing, and diversity was intermediate. Plant community structure and diversity were controlled by selective grazing by cattle and soil disturbance by cattle and rodents. Shortgrass steppe moderately or heavily grazed by cattle was similar to and probably as sustainable as steppe grazed for millenia by bison and other wild ungulates.

Throughout the studied area most of the species were polychaetes, particularly Streblospio shrubsolii (Buchanan), which showed greater abundance from May to October. Molluscs and polychaetes showed a zonation of marine species which colonize brackish environments in the outer and intermediate areas of the estuary and of brackish water species in the inner one. In the outer area different assemblages were attributed to different sediment types. This distribution pattern, put in relation to the distance from the sea, was evident in May and partly blurred in August and October: the assemblages of the inner area of the estuary invaded the intermediated area in August and affected outer area in October because of spreading of the brackish water species S. shrubsolii, which became dominant. The distribution pattern of molluscs and polychaetes can be explained in terms of confinement as the leading factor influencing water quality and dynamics of the ecosystem. It is also needed to be taken into consideration the role played by competition due to different degree of opportunism of the most abundant species.

930	WOS:000240688900016	Biodiversity and food chains on the littoral bottoms of Lakes Baikal, Biwa, Malawi and Tanganyika: working hypotheses	Hydrobiologia	9/15/2006	10.1007/s10750-006-0327-5	3	Boreal Lake Baikal, temperate Lake Biwa, and tropical Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika each possess high biodiversities of benthic organisms in their littoral areas. Two general mechanisms influencing the evolutionary development of these high biodiversities can be hypothesized; i.e., a bottom-up constraint depending on the availability of food resources, and a top-down effect exerted by predators especially within the fish assemblage. The bottom-up constraint may be prominent where the abundance of benthic organisms in the grazing-food-chain is restricted by a seasonally lowest production, referring chiefly to attached algae, and large fluctuations in the abundance of primary producers provide a resource that is eventually utilized by benthic organisms of the detritus-food-chain. The top-down effect may be realized where the most of benthic organisms are supported by a constantly large primary production. These hypotheses help to explain, for the lakes we cite, the facts that diverse grazing-food-chain organisms live on the littoral bottom of tropical lakes where there is relatively constant large algal production due to suitable conditions of water temperature and light penetration through the year; while on the other hand, detritus-food-chain organisms are predominant on the littoral bottom of a boreal lake with seasonally fluctuating algal production and its pronounced lowest production in a year. In fish communities, segregations in habitat and food resource are important mechanisms allowing development of high species packing, while cohabitation within predatory fishes increases their feeding success due to the decrease of defensive efficiency by the threat of a variety of attacking methods. A further top-down effect may be exerted by scale-eating fishes, especially in Lake Tanganyika. The presence of such predatory and harmful members may promote more dense packing of prey members to increase their mutual defense efficiency.

Freshwater insect species and their host ecosystems are widely threatened. This is particularly so within the agricultural and urban landscapes of Mediterranean-type ecosystems, including those of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. The value of 18 artificial ponds in the CFR was determined for aquatic beetle and bug abundance and species richness, a topic that has been little explored in Africa in general. 2. In total, 17 814 aquatic beetle and bug individuals were sampled, from 94 taxa, representing 37 genera and 57 species. Bugs were much more abundant than beetles, representing 82% of all the individuals collected. The beetle and bug fauna showed high levels of endemism, with 36% restricted to the Western Cape Province. 3. Five distinct groupings based on species abundances were identified, revealing overall high dissimilarities between groups, ranging from 65% to 82%. 4. The associated physico-chemical characteristics of these sites were also investigated. The most important characteristics structuring pond communities were elevation, temperature, pH, pond size and flow regime. For bugs alone, the same variables, except elevation, were important. For beetles, only three variables were found to be most important in explaining community structure: elevation, pH, and flow regime. 5. Artificial ponds in the CFR increase the area of occupancy of these insects, and therefore play a major role in conserving them. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Legnouo, Emilie A.

1673	WOS:000233858900011	Forest cover-rainfall relationships in a biodiversity hotspot: The Atlantic forest of Brazil	Ecological Applications	12/01/2005	NA	28	It is now generally accepted that the relationship between vegetation and climate is dynamic: vegetation is influenced by climate, but. feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere mean that vegetation also affects climate. From this it follows that land use changes may have climatic consequences. Specifically, it is widely believed that forest clearance may inhibit rainfall. Although models often support this view, this is not universally the case, and empirical evidence is scarce. We have compiled a database of forest cover and precipitation for the state of Sao Paulo, which lies within the diverse and highly endangered Atlantic forest region of Brazil. We do not find a strong relationship between forest cover and total rainfall, which appears to be influenced primarily by factors such as distance to the coast; but significant positive relationships between tree cover and the number of rain days consistently emerge. The degree of forest fragmentation seems to influence this relationship, with patchier forests associated with fewer rain days; and tree cover also predicts interannual variability in rainfall. The directionality of these relationships, is inferred by considering only sites which are known to have been forested in the recent past. Given that across Sao Paulo state there is no overall trend for a reduction in rainfall over the study period (1962-1992), it would appear that important local-scale processes may be hidden by regional trends. We discuss these results with reference to conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes. For instance, the spatial scale over which tree cover-precipitation relationships occur appears to be somewhat larger. than that over which studies of tropical forest fragmentation typically operate, but similar to the area, of habitat deemed necessary to maintain viable populations of several Atlantic forest species.

In the southern Appalachian Mountains, increased seasonality of climate during the changeover from glacial to interglacial conditions in the late Pleistocene and Holocene resulted in landscape instability that fostered a fine-grained, heterogeneous mosaic of habitats supporting a diverse biota. Ecotones between alpine, boreal, and temperate ecosystems in the Appalachians shifted dramatically through the Holocene in response to the passage of critical thresholds of temperature and changing disturbance regimes. Regional projections of future greenhouse-gas-induced climatic warming indicate that alpine tundra may be lost between 44 degrees and 57 degrees N and Picea rubens-Abies fraseri forests may become extinct in the southern Appalachians. Montane Picea rubens-Abies balsamea forests probably will be perpetuated between 44 degrees and 49 degrees N. Disjunct populations of alpine tundra species may persist below climatic treeline in small patches of open habitat. Biotic responses to late-Quaternary environmental changes indicate that a primary conservation emphasis should be to predict the: effects of changes in landscape-level environmental processes on biodiversity.

1820	WOS:000229448100009	Biodiversity and conservation of plants in Brazil	Conservation Biology	06/01/2005	NA	83	With more than 56,000 species (excluding fungi), Brazil has one of the richest floras in the world-nearly 19% of the world flora. Our knowledge of the diversity and status of nonvascular plants in Brazil is still fragmentary, although localized studies on algae have revealed loss of species resulting from environmental pollution. Emphasis on local floral surveys, rather than wider taxonomic studies, has obscured estimates of national totals for most taxonomic groups. Knowledge of angiosperms, especially monocotyledons (of which 45% of the species are endemic), is more complete than most. For this group figures are more reliable, with some distribution patterns, endemism levels, and centers of diversity identified. Much, however, still awaits discovery. Coordinated efforts to catalog Brazil's flora are in progress and include projects such as the conservation priority-setting workshops of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, which have identified key conservation areas in the major biomes; development of threatened species lists for plants; and the assembly of type data on species of northeastern Brazil through the Darwin Initiative-all of which greatly assist in increasing our knowledge. These initiatives also underline the urgent need to expand the numbers and geographic spread of projects on plant systematics and taxonomy in Brazil, a measure that demands adequate provision of funding and training programs for plant specialists. Finally, Brazil's environmental agency (IBAMA) could play a proactive role in opening protected areas under its jurisdiction, thereby facilitating botanical research by university departments and research institutes.

Any given conservation project can be described in terms of the biodiversity targets, direct threats, contributing factors at the project site, and the conservation actions that the project team is employing to change the situation. These common elements can be linked in a causal chain, which represents a theory of change about how the conservation actions are intended to bring about desired project outcomes. If project teams want to describe and share their work and learn from one another, they need a standard and precise lexicon to specifically describe each node along this chain. To date, there have been several independent efforts to develop standard classifications for the direct threats that affect biodiversity and the conservation actions required to counteract these threats. Recognizing that it is far more effective to have only one accepted global scheme, we merged these separate efforts into unified classifications of threats and actions, which we present here. Each classification is a hierarchical listing of terms and associated definitions. The classifications are comprehensive and exclusive at the upper levels of the hierarchy, expandable at the lower levels, and simple, consistent, and scalable at all levels. We tested these classifications by applying them post hoc to 1191 threatened bird species and 737 conservation projects. Almost all threats and actions could be assigned to the new classification systems, save for some cases lacking detailed information. Furthermore, the new classification systems provided an improved way of analyzing and comparing information across projects when compared with earlier systems. We believe that widespread adoption of these classifications will help practitioners more systematically identify threats and appropriate actions, managers to more efficiently set priorities and allocate resources, and most important, facilitate cross-project learning and the development of a systematic science of conservation.

2985	WOS:000232312400004	Modern tropical forest taphonomy: Does high biodiversity affect paleoclimatic interpretations?	Palaios	10/01/2005	10.2110/palo.2004.P04-60	21	Modern biodiversity hotspots are characterized by high species diversity and by biotas facing a substantial threat of extinction, largely due to a high proportion of endemic taxa living in these regions. Theoretically, hotspots of biodiversity are areas of particular interest in the fossil record because of the relatively high quality and quantity of data that they may contribute to a global understanding of vegetational response to changes in climate, tectonic uplift, and ecological disturbance. Current models for climatic reconstruction that depend on leaf physiognomy are based on data sets in which species-rich tropical floras are less well represented, relative to temperate floras. Eight modern Neo-tropical floras from a range of precipitation regimes were evaluated to determine the influence that high source floral diversity has on reconstruction of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Floras are drawn from sites in Costa Rica to southern Peru, having species richness from 55 to > 400 species per plot. MAT of the sites spans a range of 24 to 28 degrees C, and MAP ranges from similar to 1600 mm to 3000 mm. By subsampling the modern floras in rank order of dominance (basal area), the importance of collecting intensity and completeness on subsequent assessments of MAT and MAP is evaluated. Biodiverse floras are good at reconstructing MAT if at least 50% of the species are included. When only 25 species are used for temperature calculations, the accuracy of the parameter is compromised, but a +/- 3 degrees C error encompasses the majority of the deviation. Application to the early Paleocene Castle Rock fossil flora of Colorado confirms the validity of subsampling in high-diversity fossil applications. However, reconstruction of MAP is fraught with problems that do not appear to be related to biodiversity of the floras. Errors on estimates of MAP currently are so large as to make the values too vague to be useful in most applications. This study has accepted a 20% error as necessary, but the applicability of data with errors > 20% is questionable in situations where rainfall is > 1500 mm per year MAP estimates using leaf area are almost universally underestimates of actual MAP, and frequently are > 400 mm in error Exploration of these data indicates that effort would be well placed in investigating the relative importance of precipitation parameters in altering leaf morphology before choosing one to reconstruct climates of the past.

Our objective was to compare the functional diversity of microbial communities in the A horizons of cultivated and uncultivated vertisols in NW New South Wales. Samples from two cultivated and two uncultivated sites were tested using the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) method. Substrate richness, the rate of substrate use and the diversity of substrate use, as measured by the Shannon index, were significantly larger in the uncultivated sites than in the cultivated sites. The CLPP also indicated a higher rate of substrate use in the uncultivated sites, although this may have been due to greater initial inoculum densities. When diversity values for each site were compared with several soil physical and chemical properties, a relationship between organic carbon and functional diversity was apparent. The fit to a broken-stick model showed that diversity increased up to 1.76% organic carbon and remained constant above that value. The implications of these results for soil quality will depend upon future investigations on the significance of soil microbial diversity as a component of soil quality.

The results show that, immigration from metacommunity is much more important than local dispersal from neighboring sites to determine the temporal species richness of local neutral community. Such an observation was consistent over different initial configurations and various immigration rates. Moreover, the calculation of Jaccard's similarity index suggests that, when regional immigration is spatially limited (i.e., individuals of species can only disperse to the edge areas of the local community from the metacommunity), temporal species compositional similarity would be usually larger than those scenarios where regional immigration is not limited. That is, species replacement in spatially limited scenarios is much slower than those scenarios where dispersal of species is unlimited. In conclusion, regional dispersal limitation plays deterministic roles on structuring species diversity patterns in local neutral communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Within PAME, quantitative approaches to assess biodiversity outcomes are now emerging, where biological monitoring data are directly assessed against quantitative (numerically defined) condition categories (termed quantitative condition assessments). However, more commonly qualitative condition assessments are employed in PAME, which use descriptive condition categories and are evaluated largely with expert judgement that can be subject to a range of biases, such as linguistic uncertainty and overconfidence. Despite the benefits of increased transparency and repeatability of evaluations, quantitative condition assessments are rarely used in PAME. To understand why, we interviewed practitioners from all Australian marine protected area (MPA) networks, which have access to long-term biological monitoring data and are developing or conducting PAME evaluations. Our research revealed that there is a desire within management agencies to implement quantitative condition assessment of biodiversity outcomes in Australian MPAs. However, practitioners report many challenges in transitioning from undertaking qualitative to quantitative condition assessments of biodiversity outcomes, which are hampering progress. Challenges include a lack of agency capacity (staff numbers and money), knowledge gaps, and diminishing public and political support for PAs. We point to opportunities to target strategies that will assist agencies overcome these challenges, including new decision support tools, approaches to better finance conservation efforts, and to promote more management relevant science. While a single solution is unlikely to achieve full evidence-based conservation, we suggest ways for agencies to target strategies and advance PAME evaluations toward best practice.

In Australia, the number and spatial area of conservation covenants has grown significantly in the past decade. Yet there has been little research or detailed policy analysis of conservation covenanting in Australia. We sought to determine how conservation covenanting agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on covenanted properties, and factors inhibiting or contributing to measuring these outcomes. In addition, we also investigated the drivers and constraints associated with actually delivering the biodiversity outcomes, drawing on detailed input from covenanting programs. Although all conservation covenanting programs had the broad aim of maintaining or improving biodiversity in their covenants in the long term, the specific stated objectives of conservation covenanting programs varied. Programs undertook monitoring and evaluation in different ways and at different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it was difficult to determine the extent Australian conservation covenanting agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on covenanted properties on a national scale. Lack of time available to covenantors to undertake management was one of the biggest impediments to achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes. A lack of financial resources and human capital to monitor, knowing what to monitor, inconsistent monitoring methodologies, a lack of benchmark data, and length of time to achieve outcomes were all considered potential barriers to monitoring the biodiversity conservation outcomes of conservation covenants.

With the depletion of local livestock populations, the introduction of new species and breeds will clearly affect biodiversity. Nevertheless, the impact of restocking on Animal Genetic Resources has been largely ignored. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to examine the consequences of restocking on biodiversity via a simple model. Utilising a hypothetical project based on cattle, the model demonstrates that more than one-third of the population was related to the original restocked animals after three generations. Under conditions of random breed selection, the figure declined to 20 per cent. The tool was then applied to a donor-led restocking project implemented in Bosnia-Herzegovina. By restocking primarily with Simmental cattle, the model demonstrated that the implementation of a single restocking project is likely to have accelerated the decline of the indigenous Busa breed by a further nine per cent. Thus, greater awareness of the long-term implications of restocking on biodiversity is required.

6873	WOS:000392069500026	Quantitative evaluation of hybridization and the impact on biodiversity conservation	Ecology and Evolution	01/01/2017	10.1002/ece3.2595	21	Anthropogenic hybridization is an increasing conservation threat worldwide. In South Africa, recent hybridization is threatening numerous ungulate taxa. For example, the genetic integrity of the near-threatened bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus) is threatened by hybridization with the more common blesbok (D. p. phillipsi). Identifying nonadmixed parental and admixed individuals is challenging based on the morphological traits alone; however, molecular analyses may allow for accurate detection. Once hybrids are identified, population simulation software may assist in determining the optimal conservation management strategy, although quantitative evaluation of hybrid management is rarely performed. In this study, our objectives were to describe species-wide and localized rates of hybridization in nearly 3,000 individuals based on 12 microsatellite loci, quantify the accuracy of hybrid assignment software (STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS), and determine an optimal threshold of bontebok ancestry for management purposes. According to multiple methods, we identified 2,051 bontebok, 657 hybrids, and 29 blesbok. More than two-thirds of locations contained at least some hybrid individuals, with populations varying in the degree of introgression. HYBRIDLAB was used to simulate four generations of coexistence between bontebok and blesbok, and to optimize a threshold of ancestry, where most hybrids will be detected and removed, and the fewest nonadmixed bontebok individuals mis-classified as hybrids. Overall, a threshold Q-value (admixture coefficient) of 0.90 would remove 94% of hybrid animals, while a threshold of 0.95 would remove 98% of hybrid animals but also 8% of nonadmixed bontebok. To this end, a threshold of 0.90 was identified as optimal and has since been implemented in formal policy by a provincial nature conservation agency. Due to widespread hybridization, effective conservation plans should be established and enforced to conserve native populations that are genetically unique.	van Wyk, Anna M. ; Dalton, Desire L. ; Hoban, Sean ; Bruford, Michael W. ; Russo, Isa-Rita M. ; Birss, Coral ; Grobler, Paul ; van Vuuren, Bettine Janse ; Kotze, Antoinette	9	5665392 ; 623716 ; 1009028 ; 71858 ; 4420145 ; 9537200 ; 1695068 ; 1296266 ; 382298	South Africa ; South Africa ; Italy ; USA ; USA ; Wales ; South Africa ; South Africa	blesbok ; bontebok ; hybridization ; hybridlab ; newhybrids ; structure	2017	Nuria Mac√≠as	yes	Afrotropical	South Africa	2009	Terrestrial	NA	Field sampling	0	0	NA	Biodiversity conservation	0	0	0	Mammals	0	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Genetic hybridization microsatellites

This comparison serves as an indicator of what sorts of changes might exist between modern humans living in Western culture compared to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. However, immunological experiments on wild-caught animals are difficult and potentially confounded by increased levels of stress in the captive animals. In this study, the humoral immune responses of laboratory rats in a traditional laboratory environment and in an environment with enriched biodiversity were examined following immunization with a panel of antigens. Biodiversity enrichment included colonization of the laboratory animals with helminths and co-housing the laboratory animals with wild-caught rats. Increased biodiversity did not apparently affect the IgE response to peanut antigens following immunization with those antigens. However, animals housed in the enriched biodiversity setting demonstrated an increased mean humoral response to T-independent and T-dependent antigens and increased levels of \""natural\"" antibodies directed at a xenogeneic protein and at an autologous tissue extract that were not used as immunogens."

It draws attention to the likelihood that, contrary to popular belief, biodiversity was enhanced by interactions between agricultural communities and woodlands. The possible purposefulness of such interactions is discussed. Mindful of the present concern to re-establish 'native' woodlands in many parts of northern Britain, we then review three approaches to the identification of native tree types in Scotland, and conclude that insufficient attention in reafforestation schemes is being paid to (a) the palaeoecological record as a record of native woodland or (b) the likely former high taxonomic diversity of woodlands. Both these failings will lead to the creation of new woodlands lacking in species diversity.

Landscape and Urban Planning	5/30/2009	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2008.11.007	35	Biotic aspects of business site environments - flora and fauna and the landscape they inhabit - are not yet fully addressed in sustainable business site design. In this study a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) framework was developed with which scenarios were assessed that include various measures (elaborating five defined design and management principles) to enhance biodiversity at business site. Discrimination among the scenarios was based on socioeconomic and environmental criteria, both monetary and nonmonetary. With this MCA framework, it was illustrated how different stakeholder groups (companies, employees, local governments, neighbors and environmental NGOs) in the Netherlands may rank scenarios for enhancing biodiversity at business sites, based on stakeholders' preferences. This ranking of scenarios proved rather robust, as in an uncertainty analyses (run for a large range of both weights and scores) the ranking remains the same for most runs. Scenarios that include a large amount of urban green emerged as the favorite of all stakeholders, including companies and local governments. Besides it was found that implementing measures to enhance biodiversity may be acceptable only if combined with other 'urban green' functions (predominately related to 'recreation' and 'health and well-being') and if tailored to the required functional appearance of the business site environment (in terms of 'external appearance' and 'tidiness'). Thus, the study broadens the concept of sustainable business site development by focusing on strategies to enhance biodiversity and landscape values at business sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed over 24 years of ichthyoplankton data from the Gulf of Alaska to evaluate lower trophic level responses to environmental change and judge their usefulness as ecological indicators. We standardized abundance data for each of 77 ichthyoplankton taxa, and used the Bray-Curtis distance measure and Flexible Beta linkage method, which grouped them into 22 discrete clusters. Variance Partitioning Analysis stressed the importance of geographical and seasonal processes for ichthyoplankton dynamics, and helped us identify the specific region(s) and month(s) for each response variable (cluster abundance, diversity) in which annual variation was maximized. Response variables were linked to environmental explanatory variables (atmospheric pressure, temperature, salinity and circulation indices) by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The North Pacific Index (atmospheric pressure) and meso-scale climate variables like the El Ni (n) over tildeo Index (temperature), wind, and freshwater input (circulation) had the strongest impacts on ichthyoplankton species clusters. Specifically, the El Ni (n) over tildeo Index was negatively correlated with several ichthyoplankton clusters that were dominated by cold water species. Circulation was predominantly positively related to diversity and ichthyoplankton clusters, with the exception of clusters that mainly consisted of offshore taxa. The immediate response of ichthyoplankton to environmental forcing might make them suitable ecological indicators of environmental change although additional work is needed to assess affects on survival and recruitment.

Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 The catch of small-scale fishery by trammel net along the Sicilian coast, between the years 1997 and 1999, was investigated. The biodiversity of the catch was considered among six sample ports. Richness (S), Simpson's index (d), Pielou's index (1) and Shannon-Wiener's index (H) were used as measures of biodiversity. The richness of fish species is particularly important for monitoring habitat degradation and human impact. The very high biodiversity of the Mediterranean sea is under pressure from human impact and climate change.

Two common forms of such governance are protected areas, and community lands open to limited resource extraction. We studied wildlife occurrences in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (EWS) is situated adjacent to community lands governed by the Bugun and Sherdukpen tribes. We conducted transect-based mammal sign surveys and camera trapping for mammals (>0.5 kg), and interviewed members of the resident tribes to understand their hunting practices and causes of wildlife declines. Interviews indicated hunting-mediated declines in the abundances of mammals such as the tiger Panthera tigris, gaur Bos gaurus and river otters Lutrogale and Aonyx species. Larger species such as B. gaurus were much more abundant within EWS than outside of it. Community-managed lands harbored smaller bodied species, including some of conservation importance such as the red panda Ailurus fulgens, clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa and golden cat Pardofelis temminckii. Our findings show that protected areas may have important non-substitutive values but adjoining community-managed lands may also have important conservation values for a different set of species.

This depends on the ability of ecosystem engineers to persist and continue to ameliorate thermal stress under changing climatic conditions-traits that may display significant intraspecific variation. In the physically stressful intertidal, the complex three-dimensional structure of oysters provides shading and traps moisture during aerial exposure at low tide. We assessed variation in the capacity of a faster- and slower-growing population of the Sydney Rock Oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, to persist, form three-dimensional structure and provide a cool microhabitat to invertebrates under warmer conditions. The two populations of oysters were exposed to a temperature gradient in the field by attaching them to passively warmed white, grey and black stone pavers and their growth, survivorship and colonisation by invertebrates was monitored over a 12-month period. Oysters displayed a trade-off between fast growth and thermal tolerance. The growth advantage of the fast-growing population diminished with increasing substrate temperature, and at higher temperatures, the faster-growing oysters suffered greater mortality, formed less habitat, and were consequently less effective at ameliorating low-tide air temperature extremes than slower-growing oysters. The greater survivorship of slower-growing oysters, in turn, produced a cooler microclimate which fed back to further bolster oyster survivorship. Invertebrate recruitment increased with habitat cover and was greater among the slower than the faster-growing population. Our results show that the capacity of ecosystem engineers to serve as microhabitat refugia to associated organisms in a warming climate displays marked intraspecific variation. Our study also adds to growing evidence that fast growth may come at the expense of thermal tolerance.

8705	WOS:000497781700001	Are protected areas effective in preserving anurans and promoting biodiversity discoveries in the Brazilian Cerrado?	Journal for Nature Conservation	12/01/2019	10.1016/j.jnc.2019.125734	4	The current biodiversity crisis has stimulated the creation of protected areas, a fundamental conservation tool for halting biodiversity loss. Moreover, protected areas are often accessed by researchers for field observations and natural experiments, thus representing also an important tool promoting biodiversity discoveries. Here, we investigated the importance of protected areas in achieving both conservation and scientific roles for anurans in the Brazilian Cerrado. We specifically compared species richness, species geographical range size, time since species description, and species body size from 173 anurans between 18 protected and seven non-protected areas. We expect that conservation role would be fulfilled if higher species richness is represented into protected than non-protected areas. Similarly, if reserves are effective tools in promoting biodiversity discoveries, we expect a higher number of less detectable (narrow-ranged and small-bodied) and recently described species into protected areas. The estimated species richness was significantly higher in protected than non-protected areas (t = 12.82; df = 6; p < 0.001), whereas species geographic range (t = -3.24; df = 65.9; p= 0.002) and time since the species description (t = -2.49; df = 86.4; p= 0.015) were significantly lower. Species body size did not differ between areas. Our results indicate that reserves positively achieved the conservation role, and have been promoting scientific discoveries of new anurans in the Brazilian Cerrado. However, although favorable for most narrow-ranged anurans surviving, reserves are spatially relatively limited and isolated from each other, precluding large populations and gene flow. Our findings reinforce the need to increase the coverage of protected areas in the Brazilian Cerrado to continue maintaining a considerable number of species, but potentially expanding their geographical ranges and populations, as well as fully supporting biodiversity discoveries.

However, no study has identified an explicit connection between urbanization and biodiversity loss as the impact of urbanization is typically inferred indirectly by comparing species diversity along urban-rural gradients at a single time point. A different approach is to focus on the temporal rather than the spatial aspect and perform \""before and after\"" studies where species diversity is cataloged over time in the same sites. The current study examined changes in ant abundance and diversity associated with the conversion of natural habitats into urban habitats. Ant abundance and diversity were tracked in forested sites that became urbanized through construction and were examined at 3 time points - before, during, and after construction. On average, 4.3 +/- 1.2 unique species were detected in undisturbed plots prior to construction. Ant diversity decreased to 0.7 +/- 0.8 species in plots undergoing construction and 1.5 +/- 1.1 species in plots 1 year after construction was completed. With regard to species richness, urbanization resulted in the permanent loss of 17 of the 20 species initially present in the study plots. Recovery was slow and only 3 species were present right after construction was completed and 4 species were present 1 year after construction was completed. The second objective examined ant fauna recovery in developed residential lots based on time since construction, neighboring habitat quality, pesticide inputs, and the presence of invasive ants. Ant diversity was positively correlated with factors that promoted ecological recovery and negatively correlated with factors that promoted ecological degradation. Taken together, these results address a critical gap in our knowledge by characterizing the short-and long-term the effects of urbanization on the loss of ant biodiversity."

As one of the few biodiversity hotspots in central Asia, it was listed in 1986 as a Chinese national swan nature reserve, The region is also the largest grazing area in Xinjiang as well as a tourist attraction. But in the last 25 years, the population of wild swans has decreased from about 20,000 to 2000, and approximately half of the pastureland now suffers from overgrazing and degradation. Moreover, the local government has been considering building a reservoir in the region. If this is done, the ecology of this region would be greatly altered, and almost all wild-swan habitats would disappear, The present study identifies alpine grassland types and concludes that it is urgent to protect the breeding areas of wild swans and control grassland degradation, and that any plan for reservoir construction should be rejected.

Habitat loss and fragmentation by upward migration of bioclimatic conditions is analyzed using Species-Area Relationships (SAR) and Altitudinal Range Displacement (ARD) analysis. The ARD is a tool that uses the present-day lapse rate to estimate the upward migration of the species based on the global warming predicted by the IPCC. The results show that around 80% of the vascular flora, ca. 1,700 species of which up to 400 would be Pantepui endemics, are threatened of extinction. These estimates should be considered preliminary, but the danger is real. Therefore, suitable conservation or mitigation strategies are needed.

(2) Do we observe differences in the responses of functional diversity (reflecting differences in the interspecific variation of a trait in the plant community) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs, reflecting the characteristics of the dominant species)? (3) How do diversity and CWM patterns respond to disturbance and fertilization gradients measured by agronomic descriptors in both parcel types? LocationFrench Jura Mountains. MethodsWe compared taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities (based on Rao quadratic entropy) and CWMs between the two management types (SGP and MGP). We then used agronomic variables, describing both defoliation regime and fertilization intensity over the past 10yrs to explain diversity indices and CWMs in a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA). ResultsTaxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were higher in SGP than in MGP, as well as functional diversity computed for qualitative traits (clonal growth organs and leaf distribution along the stem). Contrary to expectations from literature, we found higher CWM for leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in intensively and regularly cut grasslands compared to only grazed grasslands, which can be explained by the higher dominance of grass species in hay meadows. In addition, constrained ordination revealed that taxonomic, phylogenetic and some functional diversity metrics were negatively affected by defoliation intensity (mowing frequency), while most CWMs were mainly influenced by fertilization intensity, either by the available N input or by the role of commercial inorganic fertilizers, depending on the trait considered. ConclusionsOur study revealed consistent patterns between the various facets of biodiversity in grasslands according to the main management regime. Taking agronomic gradients into account suggests the importance of considering both CWMs and functional diversity, which respond variously to agricultural practices. Conservation of high diversity in grasslands, whatever the facet considered, implies keeping some parcels exclusively grazed and limiting N inputs, especially those from inorganic commercial fertilizers.

The species forms dense three-dimensional matrices which constitute a microhabitat for a wide variety of organisms. Here we test the hypothesis that factors determining habitat Structural complexity and environmental heterogeneity of Perumytilus matrices have significant effects oil the associated macrofaunal community. In total we found 92 invertebrate taxa in P. purpuratus matrices. The number of layers (stratification) in the matrix had a significant effect on evenness: the greater the stratification, the lower the evenness index. Sediment retention by matrices in sheltered sectors had a significant effect on evenness: greater sediment retention resulted in lower evenness. Sediment retention also determined significant differences In macrofaunal assemblages. In matrices Without sediment retention, mussel layering and the presence of algae on the shells of P. purpuratus determined significant macrofaunal differences. As a dominant competitor, P. purpuratus plays a major role in intertidal rocky shores where it is present, structuring communities and determining local biodiversity.

Ponds in watersheds with more than 30% lawn cover have few zooplankton species, no macrophytes, no snails, and no amphibians. A recent meta-analysis generated the hypothesis that watershed (catchment basin) land cover is a better predictor of lake biodiversity than traditional predictors (such as in-lake primary productivity) if the watershed includes human development (agriculture, residential, or urban). This hypothesis was tested via a field survey of 23 similar-sized artificial ponds in southern Wisconsin. The ponds had similar climate and geology, but differed in the relative proportions of land cover in the watershed. Twelve environmental variables (including pond area, depth, and primary productivity surrogates) and seven watershed land cover variables were correlated with biodiversity measures of seven major aquatic communities. Percent lawn cover was negatively correlated with zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.41), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 61), molluscan presence (r(2) = 0.48), and amphibian presence (r(2) = 0.55 for spring species and r(2) = 0.78 for summer species). Fish presence was negatively correlated with percent watershed covered by meadow (r(2) = 0.16). Chlorophyll a (a primary productivity surrogate) was negatively correlated with three groups: zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.18), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 0.23), and molluscan presence/absence (r(2) = 0.31). Total phosphorus and nitrogen (surrogates of in-lake primary productivity) were weakly correlated with biodiversity.

The context within which they operate can change rapidly and dramatically. As a result, they need to plan new strategies, and do so by taking up the challenges of strategic design like any institutionalised organization. However, the specific characteristics and situations of ENGOs call for new, relevant approaches to strategic analysis and design. Based on successive cycles of case studies and conceptual work drawing on the biodiversity and strategic management literatures, the present paper proposes a new framework to articulate four fundamental dimensions of ENGOs' strategy: the choice of goals in terms of ecological priorities; the choice of how to act and press for change; the development of capacity (i.e. organization, internal governance and resources); and finally, a strategy to manage an often ambivalent mix of competition and cooperation with other ENGOs. The value of the framework is illustrated here by a case study of the French NGO 'Humanit, et Biodiversit,' (mankind and biodiversity), with dramatic changes in strategy to match and major strategic organizational challenges to be identified and resolved.

We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales.

Despite much evidence of land-use impacts on freshwater biodiversity, long-term changes to groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and their post-disturbance recovery, remain largely milmown. We examined long-term changes of bryophyte communities in 34 boreal springs from 1987 to 2015. In 1987, all the study springs were in near-pristine condition, but 29 of them were disturbed by peatland drainage in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Five sites retained their natural status throughout the study and were used as reference sites. We aimed to assess whether bryophyte vegetation, particularly spring specialist bryophytes, showed gradual recovery toward near-pristine conditions or whether the drainage-induced habitat degradation had caused delayed extinctions of specialists, leading to dominance by generalist taxa. Bryophyte diversity showed no signs of recovery about 20 years since the initial disturbance. In disturbed springs, the abundance of specialists first decreased, then remained relatively stable. Specialist richness decreased steadily and their community composition shifted gradually from the pre-disturbance state. Abundance of habitat generalists did not change but generalist richness also decreased with a time lag. At the same time, both groups remained unaltered in undisturbed springs. We conclude that without restoration measures that improve groundwater hydrology the self-recovery potential of springs is very low. As little is currently known about the effectiveness of spring restoration in halting spring biodiversity loss, the safest management strategy is to refrain from land use within broad buffers around springs.

Increased anthropogenic interventions into. the natural landscape have carved out separate niche in the biosphere by modifying the ecosystems drastically. In the process we have been loosing biodivenity at faster rate than expected. Hence, sustainable management of our biological resources has become key issue for survival of planet earth. Space has provided holistic view to the planet earth. The satellite remote sensing has enabled to map and monitor vegetation resources in varying scale and time. The geographic information system enables to organize the data sets for analysis and decision making process. India has Made significant efforts to build state of art satellite systems and develop applications to manage the natural resources.' Forest vegetation mapping and biodiversity characterisation at landscape level using satellite remote sensing technology is already an operational tool. Under a national scientific initiative India has developed comprehensive data base on vegetation types, fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness at landscape level in the important ecoregions of the country. This has been achieved by integrating the geospatial information on biological, physical, environmental, social and knowledge base. Remote sensing from space has facilitated systematic and hierarchical approach of biodiversity assessment and its monitoring. Hence biodiversity conservation strategy must include the information for defining the action.

Tropical agriculture, particularly intensive agriculture, often supports few native organisms, and consequently has been largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet, recent work in the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain features can support significant biodiversity, decades after conversion to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here, we quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in southwest India, a region continuously cultivated for >2,000 years. We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems retain 90% of the bird species associated with regional native forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First, the system involves intercropping with multiple, usually woody, understory species and, thus, has high vertical structural complexity that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second, the system encompasses nearby forests, where large quantities of leaf litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to arecanut cultivation. The long-term biodiversity value of an agricultural ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops. Some of these working lands may be able to sustain native species over long-time scales, indicating that conservation investments in agriculture today could pay off for people and for nature.

In this study we show the utility of combining the concepts and methodologies developed within the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research program with J. H. Connell and R. O. Slatyer's classic framework to understand succession in assemblages where multiple interactions between early and late colonists may include both inhibitory and facilitative effects. We assessed the net effect of multiple species interactions on successional changes by manipulating the richness, composition, and abundance of early colonists in a low-shore assemblage of algae and invertebrates of the northwestern Mediterranean. Results revealed how concomitant changes in species richness and abundance can strongly alter the net effect of inhibitory vs. facilitative interactions on succession. Increasing richness of early colonists inhibited succession, but only under high levels of initial abundance, probably reflecting the formation of a highly intricate matrix that prevented further colonization. In contrast, increasing initial abundance of early colonists tended to facilitate succession under low richness. Thus, changes in abundance of early colonists mediated the effects of richness on succession.

Archives Des Sciences	01/12/2004	NA	21	The European Directive on urban wastewater treatment voted in 1991, compelled industries to deal with their wastewater As a result, highways companies had to dig stormwater detention ponds alongside roads mainly in order to catch and treat road runoff. These stormwater ponds were quickly and largely colonised by aquatic organisms while they were only designed for a technical purpose. But if many of them have been dug all over Europe, their use by wildlife remains poorly studied. This article aims at taking stock of the role of highway stormwater detention ponds for biodiversity by (i) reviewing the knowledge on the chemical contamination found into it and (ii) addressing the problem of the use of these stormwater ponds by wildlife. The discussion is based on a survey conducted during one year (2002 - 2003) on six highway stormwater detention ponds situated in south-eastern France.

Although we found a positive relationship between production in monoculture and dominance in mixtures as predicted by the SEH, the relationship had low explanatory power. Counter to predictions, the species with the highest monoculture biomass were not able to strongly dominate all mixtures; instead the dominance of these species decreased with increasing species richness. On average, polycultures did not achieve greater biomass than (transgressively overyield) the species in each mixture, or at each site, that was most productive in monoculture. However, mixture yields did transgressively overyield both the monoculture biomass of the dominant species in the mixtures, and the weighted average of all monocultures (non-transgressive overyielding), both of which were positively related to increasing species richness. The varying responses of different overyielding tests resulted because resource partitioning and positive interactions were often counter-balanced by selection for species with lower biomass than the highest-yielding monocultures. Judging whether or not mixtures overyield therefore depends in part upon which species is the basis for comparison. We present a new general framework for overyielding analysis where every monoculture provides a potential comparison and from which the most relevant tests can be selected.

However, standard protocols for ecological risk assessments use endpoints that are not directly related to biodiversity. In the present study, the changes in five biodiversity indicators, namely, the Hill, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity index, AZTI's Marine Benthic Index (AMBI), and Benthic Quality Index (BQI), are calculated in case species experience direct chemical effects. This is done for an uncontaminated situation as well as for situations in which the effect concentration of a certain fraction of species (x%) is exceeded, that is, at the hazardous concentration (HCx) of the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of the considered community. Results indicate that the response of the biodiversity indicators to concentrations spanning the complete concentration range of the SSD is variable. This response depends mainly on the type of indicator, the species assemblage, and the ratio of the slope of the concentration effect curves of the species and the slope of the SSD. At the HC5, a commonly used threshold in environmental risk assessment, biodiversity indicators, are affected at a marginal level (change is less than 5% in 99.6% of the simulated cases). Based on the results, the HC5 level is likely to be a protective threshold for changes in biodiversity in terms of richness and heterogeneity in the vast majority of the simulated cases (99.6%) for chemicals for which direct effects are dominant.

Emphasis was on long-term societal and environmental benefits in addition to financial gain for the company. The systematic, cyclical adaptive management process was used to generate feedback for SPDP managers. Adaptive management enables ongoing improvement of management policies and practices based on lessons learned from operational activities. Previous to this study, very little information about the local biodiversity was available. Over a 2-year period, the team conducted biological assessments of six taxonomic groups at five sites located within 600 km(2). A broad range of management options such as location, timing and technology were developed from the beginning of the project. They were considered in conjunction with emerging lessons from the biodiversity assessments. Critical decisions included location of a gas plant and the cost of helicopter access versus roads to service the full field development. Both of these decisions were evaluated to ensure that they were economically and environmentally feasible. Project design changes, addressed in the planning stage, were accepted once consensus was achieved. Stakeholders were apprised of the implications of the baseline biodiversity assessments.

We identified influences of site conditions and management type on grassland biodiversity, and specifically evaluated the effectiveness of the agri-environmental programme in the Alps. Vascular plants and grasshoppers were mapped in conventionally managed cut meadows, cut meadows of the ecological compensation programme (ECA meadows), and conventionally managed pastures (n = 324). We determined climatic and topographic site conditions, quantified the degree of remoteness of all plots in GIS, and estimated the habitat diversity in the vicinity of the sampling sites. The data were analysed by discriminant analysis, rank-correlation analysis, non-parametric ANOVA, general linear models, and ANCOVA. Plant biodiversity hot spots were in economically unattractive, remote sites. These were the typical site conditions of ECA meadows. Hence we concluded that the ecological compensation programme was effectively ensuring management at these sites, and thus protecting mountain grassland plant species richness. Grasshoppers seemed not to benefit from mountain ECA meadows, which were probably often situated at the climatic limit of several species. Pastures were the most species rich management type (plants and grasshoppers), but conversion from cut grassland to pastures should be limited, as negative economic and ecological effects have been reported. We propose that the co-existence of well-managed pastures and long-term ECA meadows might best conserve mountain grassland biodiversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In 1992, the EU provided the member states with its Agri-environment Regulation 2078/92 to help member states reverse these developments by means of agri-environment schemes. The question is: will the implementation of these schemes be sufficient to restore the biological diversity on farmland? Most studies that have examined the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes have focussed on farmland birds in Great Britain and The Netherlands. So far, the positive effects appear to be limited. Continuous evaluation and adaptation of these schemes is needed to enable the biodiversity on farmland to recover from the EU's former policy.

Location The Atlantic forest, stretching along the Brazilian coast. Methods We model the spatial range of the forest under three climatic scenarios (current climate, 6000 and 21,000 years ago) with BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Historically stable areas or refugia are identified as the set of grid cells for which forest presence is inferred in all models and time projections. To validate inferred refugia, we test whether our models are matched by the current distribution of the forest and by fossil pollen data. We then investigate whether the location of inferred forest refugia is consistent with current patterns of species endemism and existing phylogeographical data. Results Forest models agree with pollen records and predict a large area of historical forest stability in the central corridor (Bahia), as well as a smaller refuge (Pernambuco) along the Brazilian coast, matching current centres of endemism in multiple taxa and mtDNA diversity patterns in a subset of the species examined. Less historical stability is predicted in coastal areas south of the Doce river, which agrees with most phylogeographical studies in that region. Yet some widely distributed taxa show high endemism in the southern Atlantic forest. This may be due to limitations of the modelling approach, differences in ecology and dispersal capability, historical processes not contemplated by the current study or inadequacy of the available test data sets. Main conclusions Palaeoclimatic models predict the presence of historical forest refugia in the Atlantic rain forest and suggest spatial variation in persistence of forests through the Pleistocene, predicting patterns of biodiversity in several local taxa. The results point to the need for further studies to document genetic and species endemism in the relatively poorly known and highly impacted areas of Atlantic rain forests of north-eastern Brazil.

Temporal changes in diversification rate and possible correlations with the biogeographical history of the group were examined. We performed parametric ancestral area reconstruction incorporating a stratified palaeogeographical model that reflects changes in terrestrial configuration and the presence of phytogeographical connections through time in the western Indian Ocean Basin. Shifts in diversification rate were compared with ancestral area assignments and divergence age estimates. ResultsIndian Ocean Primulaceae were recovered as monophyletic with a sister relationship to Asian Ardisia. Oncostemum, a genus confined to Madagascar and the Comoros, was resolved as paraphyletic by the inclusion of a monophyletic Mascarene Badula group consisting of single-island endemics. We found evidence for diversification bursts early in the history of Indian Ocean Primulaceae that correspond closely to the sequence of dispersal and the appearance of newly formed Mascarene Islands. Age estimates suggest a dispersal to Rodrigues that is older than the estimated geological age of the island. Main conclusionsResults suggest a Madagascan origin of Indian Ocean Primulaceae with subsequent dispersal to the Mascarenes in the middle to late Miocene, with initial establishment on either Mauritius or Rodrigues and subsequent stepping-stone dispersal to the other two Mascarene islands within the last 2Myr. Analyses suggest that diversification has slowed over time, with significant rate changes following dispersal to new geographical areas. Onset of diversification in species-rich Oncostemum appears to have been recent, with major cladogenesis commencing in the early Pliocene.

Here we review the history and activities of AP-BON (Asia-Pacific Biodiversity Observation Network), an active network of biodiversity observation in the Asia-Pacific region. AP-BON was organized in 2009, 1 year earlier than CBD COP 10 in 2010, and developed through four workshops and additional related meetings. The most recent, the fourth, AP-BON workshop was held in 2011, wherein implementation for 20122015 was confirmed. Major activities planned for 2012-2015 are (1) editing and networking the national biodiversity outlook, (2) publication of additional AP-BON books, (3) promotion of collaborative projects, (4) development of a shared database, and (5) capacity building. As for the third activity, implementation for 20122015 has been developed in five working groups (WGs). WG 1 (genetics/phylogenetic diversity) is promoting genetic diversity assessment to contribute to a GEO BON genetic diversity report. WG 2 is carrying out plant diversity assessments using a standardized transect method in Southeast (SE) Asian countries. WG 3 (terrestrial ecosystem) is developing (1) networks of in situ monitoring and a database on terrestrial ecosystems, (2) a database on function and services of terrestrial ecosystems, and (3) maps of biodiversity, function, and ecosystem services. WG 4 (freshwater) is monitoring Asian freshwater biodiversity at the genus, species, and ecosystem levels, focusing on fish and aquatic plants. WG 5 (marine) is developing a database to share biodiversity information and collecting data on kelp forests, seagrass meadows, coral reefs, pelagic water, and the deep sea. An important role of AP BON is to network these projects by providing opportunities for communication and interaction, developing tools for data collection, sharing, analysis, and synthesis, and carrying out assessments helpful for improving ecosystem management and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the intraspecific level remains poorly understood, particularly in eastern Antarctica. We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two sibling amphipod species that could be collected on a circum-Antarctic scale: Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus. Haplotype networks and Bayesian phylogenies based on mitochondrial (COI, CytB) and nuclear (ITS2) DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of Eusirus, with several occurring in sympatry and at least one likely to have a true circum- Antarctic distribution. Within species, gene flow was often highly restricted, consistent with a brooding life history and in some cases suggestive of current or future allopatric speciation. Patterns of genetic structure were not always predictable: one cryptic species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation across similar to 150 km in eastern Antarctica (F-ST > 0.47, P < 0.01), yet another was remarkably homogenous across similar to 5000 km (F-ST = 0.00, P = 1.00). Genetic diversity also varied among cryptic species, independent of sample size (pi = 0.00-0.99). These results indicate several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic amphipods that are neither apparent from previous taxonomic or ecological studies nor predictable from their life history. Such genetic diversity and structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic benthic organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent re-establishment of populations on the shelf, and highlight our misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species diversity.

Natural biogeochemical processes and diverse communities of aquatic biota regulate freshwater quantity and quality in ways that are not sufficiently acknowledged nor appreciated by the water resources management community. The establishment and enforcement of environmental flow requirements offer promising means to improve and care for these critical environmental services. This Special Issue provides new insights and novel techniques to determine, protect and restore ecologically and socially sustainable flow regimes, and thereby help achieve the water-related goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2. Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows' left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains. 3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA). 4. Advances in the allocation of flood flows along the River Murray in Australia, an Ecosystems Function Model (HEC-EFM) for the Bill Williams River restoration programme in Arizona ( U. S. A), the European Water Framework Directive, and improved management of hydroelectric dams demonstrate the potential for significant ecological recovery following partial restoration of natural river flow regimes. 5. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, the action agenda of the 2007 Brisbane Declaration on environmental flows and the wider literature, we propose an invigorated global research programme to construct and calibrate hydro-ecological models and to quantify the ecological goods and services provided by rivers in contrasting hydro-climatic settings across the globe. A major challenge will be to find acceptable ways to manage rivers for multiple uses. Climate change intensifies the urgency. Environmental flows help to preserve the innate resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and thereby offer the promise of improved sustainability and wellbeing for people as well as for ecosystems.

To deal with this gap, 3-year investigation (2014-2017) on the estuary and adjacent mangrove-fringed mudflats across 17 GPS fixed sites was undertaken; the main objective being species' reconnaissance, abundance, and diversity in relation to environmental conditions. Overall, 40 species of brachyurans (27 genera and 17 families) were recorded from mangrove mudflats and estuary, of which Portunids outnumbered others. Nine species namely, Elamena xavieri, Carcinoplax longimana, C. longipes, Typhlocarcinus villosus, Arcania heptacantha, Paranursia abbreviata, Leucosia anatum, Venitus latreillei, and Arcotheres purpureus are new records for this region. Multivariate analysis through Bray-Curtis similarity using SIMPROF in PRIMER, recognized four brachyuran assemblages (ANOSIM, Global R 0.936; p<0.001) characterizing mangrove mudflats (Neodorippe callida-Scylla serrata assemblage; salinity 21.88 PSU; silty loam sediments, organic matter 2%); seaward areas (Charybdis hellerii assemblage, salinity, 27.41 PSU; loamy sand, organic matter 0.85%); mid-estuary (Portunus sanguinolentus-P. pelagicus assemblage; salinity, 23.29 PSU, sandy, 0.64% organic matter) and riverine-end (Doclea rissonii assemblage; low salinity, 19.69 PSU; sandy, 0.58% organic matter). Tubuca rosea-Austruca triangularis assemblage remained as an outlier (intertidal silty sand, organic matter 1.28%). Species accounting for dissimilarity (97.51%; SIMPER) between sites were identified. Rarefaction of samples recognized minimum brachyuran crab diversity at the riverine end and transitional areas in comparison to the seaward zone followed by mid-estuary and mangrove mudflats. Accessibility of food resources such as detritus and leaf litter through tidal surging from immediate mangrove environs appeared to support diverse species of crabs. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) delineated sediment texture and organic matter as significant factors influencing brachyuran crab community patterns. The study benefited towards building species repositories at the baseline for future monitoring assessments and eco-conservation strategies. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It supplies society with valuable ecosystem services, including the provision of food, the regeneration of nutrients and the sequestration of carbon. Technological advancements in the second half of the 20th century made large-scale exploitation of mineral, hydrocarbon and fish resources possible. These economic activities, combined with climate change impacts, constitute a considerable threat to deep-sea biodiversity. Many governments, including that of the UK, have therefore decided to implement additional protected areas in their waters of national jurisdiction. To support the decision process and to improve our understanding for the acceptance of marine conservation plans across the general public, a choice experiment survey asked Scottish households for their willingness-to-pay for additional marine protected areas in the Scottish deep-sea. This study is one of the first to use valuation methodologies to investigate public preferences for the protection of deep-sea ecosystems. The experiment focused on the elicitation of economic values for two aspects of marine biodiversity: (i) the existence value for deep-sea species and (ii) the option value of deep-sea organisms as a source for future medicinal products.

Stability was measured by a lower variability in time, and variability was estimated as temporal variance of species richness, total abundance (density or % cover) and community structure (using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities on species composition and abundance). Stability generally decreased with species richness. Temporal variability in species richness increased with the number of species at both quadrat (<1 m(2)) and site (similar to 100 m(2)) scales, while no relationship was observed by multivariate analyses. Positive relationships were also observed at the scale of site between temporal variability in species richness and variability in community structure with evenness estimates. This implies that the relationship between species richness or evenness and species richness variability is slightly positive and depends on the scale of observation. Thus, species richness does not stabilize temporal fluctuations in species number, rather species rich assemblages are those most likely to undergo the largest fluctuations in species numbers and abundance from time to time. Changes within community assemblages in terms of structure are, however, generally independent of biodiversity. Except for sedimentary and rock pool habitats, no relationship was observed between temporal variation of total abundances and diversity at either scale. Overall, our results emphasize that the relation between species richness and species-level measures of temporal variability depends on scale of measurements, type of habitats and the marine system (North Atlantic and Mediterranean) considered.

Since changes in biodiversity in response to human impact are known to differ widely among taxonomic groups and guilds there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate experts. We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops. As expected, overall species richness tended to decrease within this gradient of increasing habitat modification, but, in contrast to previous studies, we found the species richness between most taxonomic groups to be significantly correlated (36 out of 38 pairwise comparisons). However, on average only 48% of the variance could be explained (within the five main groups), and only a few taxonomic groups/guilds turned out to be good predictors for others: for example, trees for fruit- and nectar-feeding birds (88% explanation) and fruit-feeding butterflies (83%), endemic birds for endemic butterflies (72%), and frugivorous/nectar-feeding birds for fruit-feeding butterflies (67%). Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification. Near-primary forest sites proved to be of principal importance for conservation; however, land-use systems such as secondary forests (for understory plants, birds, and butterflies) and agroforestry systems (for butterflies) supported relatively high numbers of species and might play a significant role for biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes.

The epilith inventory comprises 47 taxa of bryozoans, 9 serpulids, 3 bivalves, 3 cirripeds, 3 foraminiferans, 2 vermetid gastropods, and 1 scleractinian coral, along with 6 rhodophyte morphotypes. Colonised surface area, carbonate accretion rates, and biodiversity peak in the deeper euphotic zone (15 and 60 m), where mature biocoenoses were established after 2 years exposure, whereas colonisation was retarded at dysphotic and aphotic depths. Particularly in the photic zone, colonised surface area, accretion rates, as well as species richness and abundance were higher on down-facing compared to up-facing surfaces. Analyses of similarity (ANOSIM) and non-metrical multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of species abundance data revealed that water depth and substrate orientation were the dominant factors controlling the community structure as a result of direct (photosynthesis) and indirect (bioerosion pressure; nutrient supply) effects of the light regime, while exposure time and substrate type had little influence. The same hierarchy applies for the ichnodiversity of bioerosion traces, but with an inverse pattern in case of substrate orientation, reflecting the interaction of encrustation and bioerosion. Positive net carbonate production rates support the development of oyster bioherms and heterozoan-dominated carbonate/volcaniclastic sediments accumulating in the Faial Channel and adjacent slope. A comparison with biogenic sediments from other Macaronesian archipelagos and seamounts demonstrates the abundance and diversity of non-tropical heterozoan carbonates in oceanic islands.

Controlled burning was also an important component of the traditional landscape management for millennia. It was mainly used to reduce litter and woody vegetation and to maintain open landscapes suitable for farming. Due to socio-economical changes traditional and sustainable use of fire was ceased and replaced by arsons and technical fires in Europe. Despite its wide application in the past and the considerable extension and frequency of current grassland fires, the impact of fire on the grassland biodiversity is still scarcely documented in Europe. The aim of this study is to offer a perspective on the issue of fire impact on grasslands, by overviewing published information and practical experiences from Hungary. Our results suggest that fire can be detrimental for several taxa (e.g. insects or ground-dwelling birds), but can also promote population growth of several endangered species by reducing litter or by creating and maintaining open habitats. We also found that fire may be effective in controlling invasive plant species. The effect of fire on grassland biodiversity may be rather context-dependent.

Viticulture is a very important economic activity in most countries with Mediterranean climate, often shaping their landscapes and culture. Grape production is affected by a number of pests and diseases, and farmers use prophylactic and response-driven pesticides to control these pests. Here we quantified the main biotic causes of crop losses in four grape castes, two red (Touriga Nacional and Baga) and two white (Arinto and Chardonnay), and evaluated the potential effect of native biodiversity to provide biotic resistance to pest outbreaks and grape losses. Specifically, the diversity and abundance of bird and insect communities in these vineyards were quantified and divided into functional guilds (pest, neutral or auxiliary), to test whether these natural communities hold the potential to naturally control grape pests (biotic resistance hypothesis) under normal vineyard management (including pesticide application regimes). A potential association between distance to the vineyard edge and grape losses was also evaluated. We recorded a very small proportion of grape losses (mean = 0.6 %; max = 7.5 %), with insect pests showing a preference for the castes Baga (red) and Chardonnay (white), while bird pests avoided the caste Arinto (white). Grape color did not influence losses caused by insect pests, but birds showed a preference for red castes. The caste Baga was also more vulnerable to losses caused by fungi. Despite their low impact on grape production, most insects and birds detected in the six vineyards were pests, which entails a potentially low level of biotic resistance in this highly managed agricultural ecosystem. Further research is necessary to fully evaluate the role of functional biodiversity in vineyards, particularly if alternative production processes, such as organic farming, can increase the potential of native biodiversity to protect against grape losses from pests under lower regimes of chemical spraying.

Alpine habitats are endangered particularly by anthropogenic influences and climate change as well as invasions of non-native plants. Although plant invasions are regarded as one of the most serious threats to biodiversity globally, the knowledge of their impact on the arthropod assemblages of alpine environments is virtually absent. Therefore, we studied the effects of the non-native dwarf pine Pinus mugo on a model group of carabid beetles in the alpine zone of the HrubA1/2 Jesenik Mts., Czech Republic. We evaluated the effects of age, cover and distance from dwarf pine stands on the community structure and the functional diversity of the Carabidae. The majority of the species significantly declined in abundance with increasing age and cover of dwarf pine stands. Species surviving there were typically food generalists associated with the forest environment. In contrast, carabids with high conservation value bound to open habitats (e.g., Amara erratica and Carabus sylvestris) decreased in dwarf pine areas as well as food specialists (e.g., Cychrus caraboides) and large forest species in the genus Carabus. The decline in abundance of carnivorous species may be a consequence of the similar decline in herbivores dependent on the native vegetation. Concurring with this interpretation, abundance of many herbivorous species (e.g. Amara spp.) decreased within pine stands. The negative effect of dwarf pine stands on the community structure of montane carabids was also apparent in changes of functional diversity. Age and cover of dwarf pine significantly decreased functional richness and divergence of carabid trophic groups. Considering the small area of alpine tundra in the Central European mountain ranges, the expansive dwarf pine represents a serious threat to this unique montane biodiversity. Therefore we recommend the immediate reduction or removal of non-native dwarf pine stands.

The Philippines is one of the world's primary banana and pineapple producers. The input-intensive style of plantation agriculture for these typically exported crops has many adverse effects on the environment. While global studies have attempted to understand the biodiversity impacts of agricultural goods, there are few studies that have investigated the Philippines specifically. In this study, Philippine policies and data are investigated to better characterize the nexus between agriculture, biodiversity, and trade. An analysis of key national policies highlights that more stringent definitions and protections for biodiversity are needed to recognize the increasing roles that agricultural production, and importantly, its global trade, have on threatened Philippine species. A geographical analysis shows that many banana and pineapple plantations in Mindanao and their surrounding agricultural impact zones overlap with ecologically important areas, such as Protected Areas and Important Bird Areas. Overlaps of recorded species occurrence are observed within the immediate zones surrounding 250 plantations for banana and pineapple in Mindanao, with 83 threatened species of Philippine fauna and tree at risk of exposure to the impacts of intensive agriculture.

Because previous studies, and their critics, have focused primarily on plants, however, it is underappreciated that the most consistent such determinism involves biased extinction of large consumers, skewing trophic structure and substantially changing conclusions about ecosystem impacts that assume changing plant diversity alone. Both demography and anthropogenic threats render large vertebrate consumers more vulnerable to extinction, on average, than plants. Importantly, species loss appears biased toward strong interactors among animals but weak interactors among plants. Accordingly, available evidence suggests that loss of a few predator species often has impacts comparable in magnitude to those stemming from a large reduction in plant diversity. Thus, the dominant impacts of biodiversity change on ecosystem functioning appear to be trophically mediated, with important implications for conservation.

To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's,agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of MG forests on macrobenthos diversity under severe water pollution in Shenzhen Bay, where water quality is strongly affected by industry and urbanization. For this purpose, we carried out a field study from December 2009 to July 2011 in the MG wetland in Shenzhen Bay, the only MG wetland located near a metropolis in mainland China. Samples were taken monthly from four habitats, namely, a reed fish pond, Gei wai ponds, mudflats and an MG forest. The results show that the seawater in all four habitats is severely polluted, and the total N, NO3-N, total phosphate, Cd, Pb and chemical oxygen demand are well over the Chinese national class IV level. The high level of organics (chemical oxygen demand and soil organic matter) and nutrients (nitrate nitrogen) has a significant positive influence (P<0.05) on the density and biomass of macrobenthos but a negative influence (P<0.05) on the diversity of the macrobenthos community. Despite the fact that the levels of organics and nutrients were also high in the MG habitat, the species biodiversity was also the most abundant of the four investigated habitats. This suggests that MG habitats have a remarkable positive effect on maintaining biological diversity compared with other habitats. Therefore, we suggest that efforts should be made to strengthen the protection of MG forests to maintain their biological diversity and promote a healthy ecological system.

There is thus a clear need to find reliable indicator taxa that can be targeted in marine conservation studies, providing cost-effective data for planning and monitoring. Using the rocky shores of the Solitary Islands Marine Park, NSW, Australia, as a model, I evaluated macroinvertebrates and determined which taxa (i) best reflected ecological patterns of the broader intertidal community; and (ii) were able to accurately predict species richness of assemblages at the headland scale. Both molluscs and crustaceans showed high levels of correlation with overall species richness. However, molluscs, and in particular prosobranchs, most closely reflected patterns in the community data and provided the most accurate predictions of species richness at the scale of the headland. The potential time savings of using molluscs in rapid assessments are considerable and relate to reductions in field time (by up to 40%) as well as the reduced need to invest time developing extensive taxonomic knowledge of other invertebrate groups. Molluscs are widespread and easily sampled, with stable taxonomy and well-known ecology relative to other marine invertebrate taxa. Their use as surrogates of biodiversity shows great potential for future marine conservation studies.

Redefining urban sustainable management to incorporate endemic fauna with particular reference to Australia	Urban Ecosystems	06/01/2016	10.1007/s11252-015-0522-0	5	An estimated 50 % of the world's population live in urban areas and this is expected to rise to 70 % by 2050. Urban developments will thus continue to encroach on non-urban landscapes and native biodiversity (flora and fauna). Although much has been written on sustainable urban development, the biodiversity component has been largely ignored. Consequently, sustainable development of biodiversity is poorly understood within urban confines by planners and designers, community developers and social planners, activists and social movements, and even academics and consultants. When native flora and fauna are incorporated deliberately or ad hoc, for example due to landscaping fashions, the outcome may create on-going issues for authorities which could be minimised with sustainable management. For example, green urban infrastructure including parks and gardens, 'backyards', remnant bushland and even wastelands can be more effectively developed to sustainably support biodiversity, typically at reduced on-going cost. However, due to the lack of understanding of this aspect of sustainable development and on-going issues of 'pest management', the focus has been on only a small sub-set of the overall biodiversity. In addition, these changes in species' dynamics often lead to the decline of local amenity for humans, and endemic species (e.g., small-bodied birds). Other taxa are typically neglected because they are cryptic, innocuous, dangerous, a nuisance, feral, or just not 'sexy'.

This evidence is contrasted by the conventional mathematical modeling, which predicts that the presence of many species and/or cooperative interactions are detrimental for ecological stability and persistence. Here we propose a modelling framework for population dynamics, which also include indirect cooperative interactions mediated by other species (e.g. habitat modification). We show that in the large system size limit, any number of species can coexist and stability increases as the number of species grows, if mediated cooperation is present, even in presence of exploitative or harmful interactions (e.g. antibiotics). Our theoretical approach thus shows that appropriate models of mediated cooperation naturally lead to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability paradox and on how highly biodiverse communities can coexist.

General mechanisms proposed to explain diversity effects include complementary resource use and invoke a key role for species' functional traits. The actual mechanisms by which complementary resource use occurs remain, however, poorly understood, as well as whether they apply to tree-dominated ecosystems. Here we present an experimental approach offering multiple innovative aspects to the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. The International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT) allows research to be conducted at several hierarchical levels within individuals, neighborhoods, and communities. The network investigates questions related to intraspecific trait variation, complementarity, and environmental stress. The goal of IDENT is to identify some of the mechanisms through which individuals and species interact to promote coexistence and the complementary use of resources. IDENT includes several implemented and planned sites in North America and Europe, and uses a replicated design of high-density tree plots of fixed species-richness levels varying in functional diversity (FD). The design reduces the space and time needed for trees to interact allowing a thorough set of mixtures varying over different diversity gradients (specific, functional, phylogenetic) and environmental conditions (e.g., water stress) to be tested in the field. The intention of this paper is to share the experience in designing FD-focused BEF experiments with trees, to favor collaborations and expand the network to different conditions.

Structurally complex habitats tend to contain more species and higher total abundances than simple habitats. This ecological paradigm is grounded in first principles: species richness scales with area, and surface area and niche density increase with three-dimensional complexity. Here we present a geometric basis for surface habitats that unifies ecosystems and spatial scales. The theory is framed by fundamental geometric constraints between three structure descriptors-surface height, rugosity and fractal dimension-and explains 98% of surface variation in a structurally complex test system: coral reefs. Then, we show how coral biodiversity metrics (species richness, total abundance and probability of interspecific encounter) vary over the theoretical structure descriptor plane, demonstrating the value of the theory for predicting the consequences of natural and human modifications of surface structure.

There is also a need to identify taxonomically tractable groups for use as cost-effective indicators when monitoring the status of biodiversity within reforested sites. Insects are an important component of terrestrial biodiversity but often require considerable resources to sample at species level. Ant genera and generic-based functional groups have been suggested as possible indicators of environmental disturbance. Here we ask to what extent the development of biodiversity is indicated by epigacic ant genera and functional groups, across different types of reforestation in tropical and subtropical Australia. In each region, we used pitfall traps to sample the ants in replicate sites of: unmanaged regrowth, monoculture and mixed species plantations and 'ecological restoration' plantings, together with reference sites in pasture and rainforest. We recorded 35 epigaeic ant genera (and 4623 individuals) from 50 tropical sites, and 39 genera (and 9904 individuals) from 54 subtropical sites, with 47 genera overall. Community composition of both genera and functional groups differed between pasture and rainforest, although many genera were widespread in both. Reforested sites were intermediate between pasture and rainforest in both regions, and showed a gradient associated with decreasing grass and increasing tree and litter cover. Older monoculture plantations and ecological restoration plantings had the most rainforest-like ant assemblages, and mixed-species cabinet timber plots the least, of the reforested sites. We conclude that ground-active ant genera and functional groups sampled in rapid surveys by pitfall-trapping showed only a modest ability to discriminate among different types of reforestation. Species-level identification, perhaps together with expanded sampling effort, could be more informative, but would require resourcing beyond the scope of rapid assessments.

This article aims to trace the domestic fuel economy at the lowland site of Naachtun, Guatemala, over 8 centuries (150-950 ce) in order to discover its role in the development of society. A significant anthracological (charcoal) dataset from household contexts is examined through multivariate analyses and sequencing. A detailed statement of taxon identification is provided. The results demonstrate that there were two systems of firewood use over time. The first consisted of the sustainable use of fragmented, diverse woodlands. The second, beginning around 750 ce, changed to a heavier reliance on multi-purpose, fruit-bearing trees and pine wood. We hypothesize that forest resource management was initially linked to an extensive, subsistence-based farming system in which mature forests and fallow land were constantly renewed, ensuring their sustainability. The change towards the use of woodlands enriched with useful plants (perhaps forest gardens or fruit tree plantations) was probably an adaptation strategy at the time of the Naachtun population peak. It suggests that fuel was now subject to a city allocation system that relied on new supply sources, some of which were potentially remote. Our results also indicate a substantially drier forest cover during at least the Early Classic period in the Naachtun region, corroborating regional palaeoclimate data. This demonstrates the reliability and usefulness of charcoal studies for palaeoecological reconstructions in the high biodiversity tropical forests of the Maya Lowlands.

While the extent of global warming may be reduced by a shift towards energy generation by large dams in order to reduce fossil-fuel use, such dams profoundly modify riverine habitats. Furthermore, the threats posed by dams and global warming will interact: for example, dams constrain range adjustments by fishes that might compensate for warming temperatures. Evaluation of their combined or synergistic effects is thus essential for adequate assessment of the consequences of planned water-resource developments. We made projections of the responses of 363 fish species within the Indo-Burma global biodiversity hotspot to the separate and joint impacts of dams and global warming. The hotspot encompasses the Lower Mekong Basin, which is the world's largest freshwater capture fishery. Projections for 81 dam-building scenarios revealed progressive impacts upon projected species richness, habitable area, and the proportion of threatened species as generating capacity increased. Projections from 126 global-warming scenarios included a rise in species richness, a reduction in habitable area, and an increase in the proportion of threatened species; however, there was substantial variation in the extent of these changes among warming projections. Projections from scenarios that combined the effects of dams and global warming were derived either by simply adding the two threats, or by combining them in a synergistic manner that took account of the likelihood that habitat shifts under global warming would be constrained by river fragmentation. Impacts on fish diversity under the synergistic projections were 10-20% higher than those attributable to additive scenarios, and were exacerbated as generating capacity increased-particularly if CO2 emissions remained high. The impacts of dams, especially those on river mainstreams, are likely to be greater, more predictable and more immediately pressing for fishes than the consequences of global warming. Limits upon dam construction should therefore be a priority action for conserving fish biodiversity in the Indo-Burma hotspot. This would minimize synergistic impacts attributable to dams plus global warming, and help ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services represented by the Lower Mekong fishery.

In this study, biodiversity of Calanoida, Copepoda, during the cold and warm seasons of 2017, were observed at 12 stations belonging to four different habitats (coral reef (CR), sheltered shallow lagoons (SSL), seagrass (SG), and open deep-water (ODW) habitats) in the Hurghada shelf, north-western Red Sea. SSL habitats were the most affected by environmental conditions, especially temperature, salinity, and depth. Some calanoid species were restricted to certain habitats, others were adapted to live in more than one habitat, while some species showed a wide distribution in all habitats. ODW habitats showed maximum diversity and density of the calanoid species. The effects of temperature and salinity were distinct in the SG and SSL. The results clearly showed that different Red Sea habitats affected the biodiversity of calanoid copepods.

The integration affords a far better degree of spatial reasoning and understanding of biodiversity issues than hitherto attended to. We attempt here to integrate satellite data, digital elevation models derived from the toposheets, slope, aspect, elevation data and known information on some elements of biodiversity. The visualization tools were applied for a case study in Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, north-east India, a global hotspot of biodiversity. The thematic features included in the visualization are habitats classified using the Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data, plant succession, hotspots of plant diversity, pheasant and takin habitat. The results were 'field tested' for acceptance among the user community. It is concluded that the visualization has a substantial role in furthering biodiversity conservation.

In an effort to understand how biodiversity patterns in the tropics will respond to individual and combined effects of these two drivers of environmental change, we use species distribution models (SDMs) calibrated for recent climate and land cover variables and projected to future scenarios to predict changes in diversity patterns in Madagascar. We collected occurrence records for 828 plant genera and 2186 plant species. We developed three scenarios, (i.e., climate only, land cover only and combined climate-land cover) based on recent and future climate and land cover variables. We used this modelling framework to investigate how the impacts of changes to climate and land cover influenced biodiversity across ecoregions and elevation bands. There were large-scale climate- and land cover-driven changes in plant biodiversity across Madagascar, including both losses and gains in diversity. The sharpest declines in biodiversity were projected for the eastern escarpment and high elevation ecosystems. Sharp declines in diversity were driven by the combined climate-land cover scenarios; however, there were subtle, region-specific differences in model outputs for each scenario, where certain regions experienced relatively higher species loss under climate or land cover only models. We strongly caution that predicted future gains in plant diversity will depend on the development and maintenance of dispersal pathways that connect current and future suitable habitats. The forecast for Madagascar's plant diversity in the face of future environmental change is worrying: regional diversity will continue to decrease in response to the combined effects of climate and land cover change, with habitats such as ericoid thickets and eastern lowland and sub-humid forests particularly vulnerable into the future.

Sequencing European groundwater crustaceans yields smaller ranges but does not challenge biodiversity determinants	Ecography	02/01/2018	10.1111/ecog.02683	35	Ecologists increasingly rely on molecular delimitation methods (MMs) to identify species boundaries, thereby potentially increasing the number of putative species because of the presence of morphologically cryptic species. It has been argued that cryptic species could challenge our understanding of what determine large-scale biodiversity patterns which have traditionally been documented from morphology alone. Here, we used morphology and three MMs to derive four different sets of putative species among the European groundwater crustaceans. Then, we used regression models to compare the relative importance of spatial heterogeneity, productivity and historical climates, in shaping species richness and range size patterns across sets of putative species. We tested three predictions. First, MMs would yield many more putative species than morphology because groundwater is a constraining environment allowing little morphological changes. Second, for species richness, MMs would increase the importance of spatial heterogeneity because cryptic species are more likely along physical barriers separating ecologically similar regions than along resource gradients promoting ecologically-based divergent selection. Third, for range size, MMs would increase the importance of historical climates because of reduced and asymmetrical fragmentation of large morphological species ranges at northern latitudes. MMs yielded twice more putative species than morphology and decreased by 10-fold the average species range size. Yet, MMs strengthened the mid-latitude ridge of high species richness and the Rapoport effect of increasing range size at higher latitudes. Species richness predictors did not vary between morphology and MMs but the latter increased the proportion of variance in range size explained by historical climates. These findings demonstrate that our knowledge of groundwater biodiversity determinants is robust to overlooked cryptic species because the latter are homogeneously distributed along environmental gradients. Yet, our findings call for incorporating multiple species delimitation methods into the analysis of large-scale biodiversity patterns across a range of taxa and ecosystems.

However, forensic identification of vertebrate tissue relies on sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) 'barcode' gene, which remains costly for purposes of screening large numbers of unknown samples during routine surveillance. Here, we adapted a rapid, low-cost approach to differentiate 10 domestic and 24 wildlife species that are common in the East African illegal wildlife products trade based on their unique high-resolution melting profiles from COI, cytochrome b, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR products. Using the approach, we identified (i) giraffe among covertly sampled meat from Kenyan butcheries, and (ii) forest elephant mitochondrial sequences among savannah elephant reference samples. This approach is being adopted for high-throughput pre-screening of potential bushmeat samples in East African forensic science pipelines.

Preliminary study of possible causes of isolation in their phoretic mites (Acari)	Vie et Milieu-Life and Environment	09/01/1997	NA	0	It seems amazing to observe such a high specific diversity in communities which have to share a microhabitat so ephemeral and transient than are dung pats, without encountering a severe interspecific competition. This coexistence is possible because of the variety of strategies of resource utilization : difference of phenology, preference of meadows or forest, diurnal or nocturnal activity and election of fresh or old dung. In this paper we study phenology and preference for the type of biotope. This avoidance of competition causes a diversification of ecological niches of beetles. Thus, some populations become unable to meet one another. So, in the Massane forest, Aphodius haemorrhoidalis, A. erraticus and A. lugens, specific of meadows, will almost never meet forest forms, A. borealis, A. fossor or A. rufipes. One can then suppose that their populations of phoretic mites have a very feeble probability of genetic flows, this may lead to sympatric isolation. On the other hand, ubiquitous hosts, such as A. fimetarius, may theoretically bear less specific mite populations. Phenology also plays a role : species active during winter, such as Aphodius constans, have very feeble chances to encounter spring or summer forms, such as A. haemorrhoidalis, A. fossor and most Scarabaeidae. These impossibilities of genetic exchanges due to the avoidance of competition play obviously a role in the speciation mechanisms of their associated phoretic mites.

451	WOS:A1995RH26500005	MANAGING BIODIVERSITY FROM A GEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE	Bulletin of Marine Science	07/01/1995	NA	1	Holocene sea-level rise has been the most significant natural influence on the evolution of both physical and biological aspects of east Central Florida's continental margin. Under conditions of rising Holocene sea level the barrier island system has retreated landward through erosional shoreface retreat. This landward retreat of the barrier island system has lead to constantly changing conditions of water quality (e.g., salinity), substrate composition, circulation, and water depth within the Indian River Lagoon. These changes have taken place over a broad range of spatial (meters to 100s of kilometers) and temporal (hours to 1,000s of years) scales. Because each of these parameters influence coastal biodiversity, it can be assumed that at least some of the historical changes noted to have occurred within the Indian River Lagoon are a natural response to Holocene sea-level rise and the concomitant landward retreat of the barrier island system. Geologic data are useful in distinguishing between the natural and anthropogenic influences on the observed trends in biodiversity and should be utilized in the development of a comprehensive monitoring or management program designed to preserve the Indian River Lagoon's impressive biodiversity and natural variability.

However, in coastal systems all indicators based on water column parameters fail in identifying the trophic status and its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We investigated benthic trophic status, in terms of sedimentary organic matter quantity, composition and quality, along with meiofaunal abundance, richness of taxa and community composition in three coastal sites (N Adriatic Sea) affected by different levels of anthropogenic stressors. We show that, on the basis of organic matter quantity and composition, the investigated areas can be classified from oligo-to mesotrophic, whereas using meiofauna as a descriptor, their environmental quality ranged from sufficient to moderately impacted. Our results show that the benthic trophic status based on organic matter variables, is not sufficient to provide a sound assessment of the environmental quality in marine coastal ecosystems. However, data reported here indicate that the integration of the meiofaunal variable allows providing robust assessments of the marine environmental status. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The River Styles((R)) framework is a geomorphic approach to the classification of river types, assessment of the physical condition of rivers, and planning of physical rehabilitation. However, the linkages between River Styles and aquatic biodiversity conservation are still only weakly developed. 2. In this study, 41 sites in the Bega River basin in New South Wales, Australia, were classified according to River Style and geomorphic condition, and surveyed for four biological assemblages: diatoms, aquatic and semi-aquatic macrophytes, aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish. 3. Each assemblage differed significantly among River Styles. However, in the case of diatoms and fish, these differences could be accounted for by geographic clustering of sites in the same River Style, and a tendency for River Styles to occupy particular altitudinal zones and sizes of streams. This result was attributed to the overriding influences of water quality on diatoms and of altitude-related variation in water temperature and distance from the ocean on fish. For macrophytes and macroinvertebrates, geomorphic river type appeared to exert a direct influence, probably via variation in physical habitat characteristics. 4. Geomorphic condition, judged as good, moderate or poor by reference to the inferred natural condition of each River Style, was also significantly associated with differences in biological assemblages other than fish. Twice as many taxa appeared to favour sites in good geomorphic condition as favoured sites in poor condition. Many of the taxa associated with sites in poor condition are alien taxa introduced to Australia since European settlement. 5. These findings imply that protection of reaches that are in good geomorphic condition is likely to be critical for the maintenance of indigenous biodiversity, and that rehabilitation of geomorphic condition can assist in the rehabilitation of native riverine biota.

We use a bio-economic approach to demonstrate that compensatory mitigation - an innovative, market-influenced approach to fishery-conservation conflicts - can facilitate high-value uses of biological resources and cost-effective conservation gains for species of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more effective from a return-on-investment perspective (ie percent increase in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries closures, and is more socio-politically feasible. A bycatch levy, which would increase with endangerment, provides an individual incentive for avoiding bycatch, the most effective mechanism for sustainable management of fisheries. Compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity to address a global concern, optimize conservation interventions, and forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations.

Across these systems, a natural stress gradient can be conceptualized, from rivers fed exclusively by meltwater (harsh habitat) to those with no melt input (relatively benign, groundwater fed). However, despite the current context of rapid glacier retreat, our understanding of linkages between meltwater contributions, physico-chemical habitat and biodiversity remains limited. To address this research gap, habitat characteristics and macro-invertebrate community structure were studied at 26 sites (five river basins) in the French Pyrenees across a meltwater gradient from 0% to 99%. A combination of generalized regression models and multivariate analyses showed that the stress gradient was associated with the following: (i) linear responses of key physico-chemical habitat variables, in particular bed stability, (ii) unimodal responses at the community level (e.g. richness and total density peaks at 40-60% meltwater contribution), and (iii) both unimodal and monotonic responses at the level of individual taxa. Sites characterized by high contributions of meltwater, although species poor, were important for beta diversity because of their specialist endemic fauna. Our findings suggest that continued glacier and snowpack retreat due to expected future climate change are likely to lead to more homogeneous alpine river habitats (i.e. reduced meltwater-groundwater stress gradient breadth). As a result, increased alpha diversity is expected as previously harsh habitats become more favourable; however, an associated decrease in beta diversity is likely as glacial stream specialists become replaced by generalists.

However, when it comes to prioritizing regions for conservation actions these measures alone are insufficient because they do not reveal how similar or different the actual composition of species may be from one area to another. For comparative analysis an additional useful metric would be one that indicates the degree to which the species assemblage in one area is also represented in-or is distinct from-species assemblages of other areas. Here we describe a method for quantifying the compositional representativeness of species assemblages among geographic regions. The method generates asymmetric pairwise similarity coefficients that are then used to calculate separate measures for the representativeness and the distinctiveness of species assemblages in the regions being compared. We demonstrate the method by comparing fish communities among freshwater ecoregions of the Mississippi Basin, and then among smaller hydrological units within two individual freshwater ecoregions. At both scales of analysis, our measures of representativeness and distinctiveness reveal patterns of fish species composition that differ from patterns of species richness. This information can enhance conservation planning processes by ensuring that priority-setting explicitly consider the most representative and distinctive species assemblages.

Most wetland habitat (85%) was converted to agriculture over a span of about 100 years (ca. 1850-1950). The consequences of this severe habitat fragmentation on wetland communities and metapopulations are unknown. We studied crustacean communities (weekly stovepipe samples throughout hydroperiods) for 3 years in a set of extant ephemeral wetlands in Illinois. We generated species-sites curves by rarefaction and extrapolated those curves to conservatively estimate that 83-85 crustacean species may have inhabited approximately 4 million ephemeral wetlands that once existed in Illinois; 8-9 crustacean species were driven to extinction in Illinois during drainage; and 75-76 crustacean species are extant in the few remaining ephemeral wetlands of Illinois. We also conducted cellular automata simulations to examine the potential effects of habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure of extant crustacean metapopulation. Simulations indicated that conversion of the former wet prairie to agriculture may have reduced crustacean metapopulations to isolated populations that are more vulnerable to future habitat loss. Despite severe habitat fragmentation, curvilinear species-sites relationships suggest that the greatest extinction rates have yet to occur for ephemeral wetland crustaceans. However, selection for limited dispersal during habitat fragmentation may contribute to extinction debt for extant species. Conservation programs can preserve much of the historical biodiversity of ephemeral wetlands, but future wetland biodiversity will depend heavily on the success of those efforts. The consequences of historical wetland loss and the importance of wetland conservation efforts to agriculture in the United States should be instructive for other regions.

However, there is evidence that pressures on the soil biota are increasing which may undermine some of these ecosystem services. Current levels of belowground biodiversity are relatively poorly known, and so no benchmark exists by which to measure possible future losses of biodiversity. Furthermore, the relative risk that each type of anthropogenic pressures places on the soil biota remains unclear. Potential threats to soil biodiversity were calculated through the use of a composite score produced from data collected from 20 international experts using the budget allocation methodology. This allowed relative weightings to be given to each of the identified pressures for which data were available in the European Soil Data Centre (ESDC). A total of seven different indicators were used for calculating the composite scores. These data were applied through a model using ArcGIS to produce a spatial analysis of composite pressures on soil biodiversity at the European scale. The model highlights the variation in the composite result of the potential threats to soil biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the intensity of land exploitation, both in terms of agriculture and use intensity, as well as in terms of land-use dynamics, were the main factors applying pressure on soil biodiversity. It is important to note that the model should not be viewed as an estimate of the current level of soil biodiversity in Europe, but as an estimate of pressures that are currently being exerted. The results obtained should be seen as a starting point for further investigation on this relatively unknown issue and demonstrate the utility of this type of model which may be applied to other regions and scales.

Biodiversity and Conservation	04/01/1998	NA	19	This paper surveys different economic aspects of biodiversity conservation in Namibia's wildlife sector. One of the main causes of biodiversity loss has been the conversion of wildlife habitat to other land uses, notably livestock and crops. However, wildlife utilization strategies potentially yield significantly higher economic rates of return compared to these traditional land uses. Historically, the move towards laud use patterns more favourable to wildlife has been hampered by a number of policy and institutional constraints. Since Namibia's independence, many of these constraints have now been removed or are in the process of reform. These moves are already encouraging investment in wildlife utilization, most notably in wildlife tourism and related activities. Some forms of wildlife utilization, particularly ecotourism and photographic safaris, will certainly complement the national and international commitment to biodiversity conservation. Consumptive uses may be economically attractive in some areas and will discourage further habitat conversion. However, uses which involve specialized management for the production of a few species may alter the species composition and functioning of ecosystems, causing conflict between the aims of wildlife utilization and biodiversity conservation. Less tangible components of biodiversity may remain under threat even under a well-designed wildlife utilization policy.

Studies on freshwater fish and amphibians suggest a third to half of the species in some tropical freshwaters is either extinct or endangered, but the status of the freshwater crabs is not known. Freshwater crabs, with 1280 species, represent one-fifth of all the World's brachyurans. We therefore undertook a comprehensive IUCN Red List assessment of the freshwater crabs, which was the first time that such a study had been attempted on a global scale for any group of freshwater invertebrates. The conservation status of all known species from the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australasia revealed unexpectedly high threat levels. Here we show that about one-sixth of all freshwater crab species have an elevated risk of extinction, only one-third are not at-risk, and although none are actually extinct, almost half are too poorly known to assess. Out of 122 countries that have populations of freshwater crabs, 43 have species in need of protection. The majority of threatened species are restricted-range semi-terrestrial endemics living in habitats subjected to deforestation, alteration of drainage patterns, and pollution. This is illustrated with a case study of one such species found in Singapore. This underlines the need to prioritize and develop conservation measures before species decline to levels from which they cannot recover. The proportion of freshwater crabs threatened with extinction is equal to that of reef-building corals, and exceeds that of all other groups that have been assessed except for amphibians. These results represent a baseline that can be used to design strategies to save the World's threatened freshwater crab species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We measured how landscaping with native plants affects the avian and lepidopteran communities on 6 pairs of suburban properties in southeastern Pennsylvania. One property in each pair was landscaped entirely with native plants and the other exhibited a more conventional suburban mixture of plants-a native canopy with non-native groundcover and shrubs. Vegetation sampling confirmed that total plant cover and plant diversity did not differ between treatments, but non-native plant cover was greater on the conventional sites and native plant cover was greater on the native sites. Several avian (abundance, species richness, biomass, and breeding-bird abundance) and larval lepidopteran (abundance and species richness) community parameters were measured from June 2006 to August 2006. Native properties supported significantly more caterpillars and caterpillar species and significantly greater bird abundance, diversity, species richness, biomass, and breeding pairs of native species. Of particular importance is that bird species of regional conservation concern were 8 times more abundant and significantly more diverse on native properties. In our study area, native landscaping positively influenced the avian and lepidopteran carrying capacity of suburbia and provided a mechanism for reducing biodiversity losses in human-dominated landscapes.

This paper aims to disentangle the relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity in multifunctional landscapes, such as floodplain agroecosystems, by disaggregating their values across land use types. We measured eight ecosystem services (gas regulation, soil formation, nutrient regulation, habitat provision, food provision, raw materials production, education, and recreation) and six plant diversity indexes (richness, abundance, and true diversity for both plant species and growth forms) in seven land use types identified in the floodplain of the River Piedra (Spain). We observed that all land use types provided services to some extent, but each one was better at providing certain services. Natural or semi-natural habitats provided more services and hosted greater diversity than cultivated land use types. In addition, five diversity indexes were strongly correlated to at least three ecosystem services each one. Habitat provision and education were the ecosystem services positively correlating to most diversity indexes, whereas food provision was negatively correlated to all diversity indexes. Moreover, analyzing the interactions between ecosystem services and biodiversity across land use types, we observed that land use type was the controlling factor regarding the sign and significance of the interaction. The results of this study suggest that, in floodplains agroecosystems, a mosaic landscape of different land use types helps support ecosystem services and contributes to maintaining biodiversity while using local resources.

Moreover, riparian forests should be preserved and restored across the floodplain as they are hot spots for biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of these, 17 distinct ITS types were identified. The described species Symbiodinium goreaui, S. kawagutii, S. pilosum (Trench and Blank), S. microadriaticum (Freudenthal), and S. (= Gymnodinium) linucheae (Trench and Thinh) had ITS sequences distinct from each other. Four of these species share identical ITS sequences with uncharacterized isolates. Sequence differences among other isolates indicate that at least seven other cultured types await formal species descriptions, whereas numerous others most likely exist in nature. The Symbiodinium phylogeny is positively correlated with cell size, mycosporine-like amino acid production (UV protection), and host infectivity, whereas the production of water-soluble peridinin-chl a-protein homodimer and monomer apoproteins and isoenzyme similarity do not correlate. There is evidence, based on the lack of phylogenetic congruency with allelic variability, that sexual recombination occurs at some frequency among Symbiodinium populations. Symbiodinium isolates from the Caribbean possess identical ITS sequences to isolates originating from the Red Sea or the western Pacific. These findings indicate that some Symbiodinium species may have global biogeographic distributions.

Biodiversity and green developmentalism	Environment and Planning d-Society & Space	04/01/1999	NA	366	New supranational environmental institutions, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the 'green' World Bank, reflect attempts to regulate international flows of 'natural capital' by means of an approach I call 'green developmentalism: These institutions are sources of eco-development dollars and of a new 'global' discourse, a postneoliberal environmental-economic paradigm. By the logic of this paradigm, nature is constructed as a world currency and ecosystems are recoded as warehouses of genetic resources for biotechnology industries. Nature would earn its own right to survive through international trade in ecosystem services and permits to pollute, access to tourism and research sites, and exports of timber, minerals, and intellectual property rights to traditional crop varieties and shamans' recipes. I contend that green developmentalism, with its promise of market solutions to environmental problems, is blunting the North-South disputes that have embroiled international environmental institutions. But by valuing local nature in relation to international markets-denominating diversity in dollars, euros, or yen-green developmentalism abstracts nature from its spatial and social contexts and reinforces the claims of global elites to the greatest share of the earth's biomass and all it contains. Meanwhile, the CBD has become a gathering ground for transnational coalitions of indigenous, peasant, and NGO opponents of 'biopiracy' and the patenting of living things, and advocates of international environmental justice. They have begun to put forward counterdiscourses and alternative practices to those of green developmentalism.

Nevertheless, they have limitations. We studied three of these limitations: (1) inadequacy of raw data to describe richness patterns due to sampling bias, (2) lack of survey effort assessment (and lack of exhaustiveness in compiling data about survey effort), and (3) lack of coverage of the geographic and environmental variations that affect the distribution of organisms. We used a biodiversity database (BIOTA-Canarias) to analyze richness data from a well-known group (seed plants) in an intensively surveyed area (Tenerife Island). Observed richness and survey effort were highly correlated. Species accumulation curves could not be used to determine survey effort because data digitalization was not exhaustive, so we identified well-sampled sites based on observed richness to sampling effort ratios. We also developed a predictive model based on the data from well-sampled sites and analyzed the origin of the geographic errors in the obtained extrapolation by means of a geographically constrained cross-validation. The spatial patterns of seed-plant species richness obtained from BIOTA-Canarias data were incomplete and biased. Therefore, some improvements are needed to use this database (and many others) in biodiversity studies. We propose a protocol that includes controls on data quality, improvements on data digitalization and survey design to improve data quality, and some alternative data analysis strategies that will provide a reliable picture of biodiversity patterns.

We sampled moth species richness within a 227-ha forest fragment and in four surrounding agricultural habitats (coffee, shade coffee, pasture, and mixed farms) in southern Costa Rica. We found no significant difference in moth species richness or abundance among agricultural habitats, but agricultural sites within 1 km of the forest fragment had significantly higher richness and abundance than sites farther than 3.5 km from the fragment. In addition, species composition differed significantly between distance classes (but not among agricultural habitats), with near sites more similar to forest than far sites. These results suggest that (1) different agricultural production regimes in this region may offer similar habitat elements and thus may not differ substantially in their capacities to support native moth populations and (2) that the majority of moths may utilize both native and agricultural habitats and move frequently between them, forming \""halos\"" of relatively high species richness and abundance around forest fragments. Correlations between species richness and the amount of nearby forest cover, measured over circles of various radii around the sites, suggest that halos extend approximately 1.0-1.4 km from the forest edge. The extent of these halos likely differs among taxa and may influence their ability to survive in fragmented landscapes."

Current and proposed protected areas cover 4 to 5% of the country and contain examples of the major terrestrial habitats. However, areas are not adequately funded or staffed, and governmental policies call for intensified logging of remaining forests. Relatively good information is available on plant community distributions and on vertebrates of the southwestern humid lowland and montane forests. Conservation projects are associated with protected areas at Dja, Kilum Mt., Korup, Mt. Cameroon, and Mt. Kupe. Other international support for the conservation of biodiversity includes projects in natural-forest management, forest inventories, and research and training at Dschang, Garoua, Maroua, and Mbalmayo. At least three international conservation organizations and six foreign assistance agencies lead or fund these activities. Conservation could be strengthened by establishment of additional integrated conservation and development projects in parks and wildlife reserves, by closer links between existing agricultural and conservation projects, and by research on project impacts.

Fishers' spatial preferences should be considered during the site selection process, but biodiversity considerations are generally the primary focus. The Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI) is a fuzzy logic spatial planning tool that combines human preferences and conservation criteria to assess the suitability of marine sites for being protected from fishing and other extractive use. We apply the PASI in zoning a marine sanctuary in Sabah, Malaysia, with the objectives of (i) assessing the PASI's ability to capture fishers' spatial preferences; and (ii) comparing the nuances of community based and fuzzy logic approaches in spatial planning. There was overlap in sites chosen for protection by both approaches, and multi-dimensional scaling results suggest that the PASI captures fishers' preferences. Community consultations enable direct integration of local knowledge to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, but can be time consuming and expensive. The PASI is an alternative to data and labour intensive conservation planning tools that are currently available, and can be particularly useful for zoning marine protected areas in data poor developing countries where conservation requires quick action.

4423	WOS:000256540300014	Increasing enemy biodiversity strengthens herbivore suppression on two plant species	Ecology	06/01/2008	NA	78	Concern over biodiversity loss, especially at higher trophic levels, has led to a surge in studies investigating how changes in natural enemy diversity affect community and ecosystem functioning. These studies have found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to 94% on potatoes and similar to 62% on collards. Increasing enemy diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants, however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.

The experiments that could extract these indirect effects at regional to continental scales are not feasible. Here, a biophysical approach quantifies environment-species interactions (ESI) that govern community change from field data. Just as species interactions depend on population abundances, so too do the effects of environment, as when drought is amplified by competition. By embedding dynamic ESI within framework that admits data gathered on different scales, we quantify responses that are induced indirectly through other species, including probabilistic uncertainty in parameters, model specification, and data. Simulation demonstrates that ESI are needed for accurate interpretation. Analysis demonstrates how nonlinear responses arise even when their direct responses to environment are linear. Applications to experimental lakes and the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) yield contrasting estimates of ESI. In closed lakes, interactions involving phytoplankton and their zooplankton grazers play a large role. By contrast, ESI are weak in BBS, as expected where year-to-year movement degrades the link between local population growth and species interactions. In both cases, nonlinear responses to environmental gradients are induced by interactions between species. Stability analysis indi-cates stability in the closed-system lakes and instability in BBS. The probabilistic framework has direct application to conservation planning that must weigh risk assessments for entire habitats and communities against competing interests.

We tested whether native and exotic grasslands differ in species diversity, ecosystem services, and an important aspect of functional diversity (C-3:C-4 proportions) by sampling 42 sites along a latitudinal gradient and conducting a controlled experiment. Exotic-dominated grasslands had drastically lower plant diversity and slightly higher tissue N concentrations and forage quality compared to native-dominated sites. Exotic sites were strongly dominated by C-4 species at southern and C-3 species at northern latitudes with a sharp transition at 36-38A degrees, whereas native sites contained C-3:C-4 mixtures. Large differences in C-3:C-4 proportions and temporal niche partitioning were found between native and exotic mixtures in the experiment, implying that differences in C-3:C-4 proportions along the latitudinal gradient are caused partially by species themselves. Our results indicate that the replacement of native- by exotic-dominated grasslands has created a management tradeoff (high diversity versus high levels of certain ecosystem services) and that models of global change impacts and C-3/C-4 distribution should consider effects of exotic species.

Mass extinctions evidently alter extinction selectivity, with many factors losing effectiveness except for a positive relation between survivorship and geographic range at the clade level (confirmed in reanalyses of end-Cretaceous extinction data). This relation probably also holds during \""normal\"" times, but changes both slope and intercept with increasing extinction. The strong geographical component to clade dynamics can obscure causation in the extinction of a feature or a clade, owing to hitchhiking effects on geographic range, so that multifactorial analyses are needed. Some extinctions are spatially complex, and regional extinctions might either reset a diversity ceiling or create a diversification debt open to further diversification or invasion. Evolutionary recoveries also exhibit spatial dynamics, including regional differences in invasibilty, and expansion of clades from the tropics fuels at least some recoveries, as well as biodiversity dynamics during normal times. Incumbency effects apparently correlate more closely with extinction intensities than with standing diversities, so that regions with higher local and global extinctions are more subject to invasion; the latest Cenozoic temperate zones evidently received more invaders than the tropics or poles, but this dynamic could shift dramatically if tropical diversity is strongly depleted. The fossil record can provide valuable insights, and their application to present-day issues will be enhanced by partitioning past and present-day extinctions by driving mechanism rather than emphasizing intensity."

However, outcomes from these projects, which are crucial for making strategies and developing an appropriate incentive mechanism for REDD+ particularly in relation to impacts on biodiversity, are little researched. The overarching goal of this research is to assess carbon stock and species richness in pilot REDD+ projects in community forests. Forest inventories data for three consecutive years are analysed for projects in Nepal. This study found increases in carbon stocks in forests for all altitudes and canopy types. Forests with dense canopy cover have higher increments compared to sparse canopy. Similarly, forests of lower altitudes have higher carbon stock compared to higher altitudes. The increment is higher in the forests located in middle altitudes which had comparatively low carbon stocks. Regarding species richness, more species are recorded in initial years of the project than later. This indicates a possible reduction in species richness with increasing the carbon stock. There is a need for an incentive mechanism for maintaining species richness together with carbon stock and securing conservation and carbon benefits in REDD+ in community forestry.

While new international policy and assessment processes such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still focused on a single facet of biodiversity-species(3). Here we broaden the focus and provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an additional 5% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics. We provide a framework and quantitative tools to advance these goals for multi-faceted biodiversity conservation.

The dominant fire management paradigm in these regions is the use of low-intensity prescribed fire early in the dry season, to reduce the incidence of higher-intensity, more extensive wildfire later in the year. This use of frequent prescribed fire to mitigate against high-intensity wildfire has parallels with fire management in temperate forests of southern Australia. However, unlike in southern Australia, the ecological implications of high fire frequency have received little attention in the north. CSIRO and collaborators recently completed a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, and here we provide a synthesis of the effects of experimental fire regimes on biodiversity, with particular consideration of fire frequency and, more specifically, time-since-fire. Two recurring themes emerged from Kapalga. First, much of the savanna biota is remarkably resilient to fire, even of high intensity. Over the 5-year experimental period, the abundance of most invertebrate groups remained unaffected by fire treatment, as did the abundance of most vertebrate species, and we were unable to detect any effect of fire on floristic composition of the grass-layer. Riparian vegetation and associated stream biota, as well as small mammals, were notable exceptions to this general resilience. Second, the occurrence of fire, independent of its intensity, was often the major factor influencing fire-sensitive species. This was especially the case for extinction-prone small mammals, which have suffered serious population declines across northern Australia in recent decades. Results from Kapalga indicate that key components of the savanna biota of northern Australia favour habitat that has remained unburnt for at least several years. This raises a serious conservation concern, given that very little relatively long unburnt habitat currently occurs in conservation reserves, with most sites being burnt at least once every 2 years. We propose a conservation objective of increasing the area that remains relatively long unburnt. This could be achieved either by reducing the proportion of the landscape burnt each year, or by setting prescribed fires more strategically. The provision of appropriately long unburnt habitat is a conservation challenge for Australia's tropical savanna landscapes, just as it is for its temperate forests.

The model is drawn as a sideways figure-eight i.e. oo. There are two dimensions in this model, connectivity (abscissa) and the amount of capital stored in the system (ordinate). This conceptual model has been suggested as a guide to thinking about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, but the two dimensions are insufficient and the alignment of the figure-eight model is problematic when compared with actual data. Kay has adjusted the dimensions of the figure-eight model and renamed the abscissa as exergy stored and the ordinate as exergy consumed. We realign the original figure-eight model, labeling the abscissa as carbon stored and the ordinate as nutrients, such that the relative values of both axes are in qualitative agreement with data from four different studies. This new alignment is then shown to fit relatively well with Holling's original labels. This revision of the figure-eight model brings Holling's model into agreement with observations and provides insight into the linkages between biodiversity and climate change.

In this study, emerging marine offsetting governance systems has been analyzed using the Actor Network Theory (ANT) with the aim of highlighting the key elements that enable the emergence of marine offsetting tools. The ANT framework has been applied to four case studies in California using data collected in a field study that consisted of interviewing 30 stakeholders working closely with the issue of marine offsetting. Employing ANT allowed to ascertain the role of commonly studied elements such as impacted ecosystems, sizing methodologies and ecological engineering techniques. Further, it highlighted the key role of other critical factors, such as 'skilled intermediaries', who succeed in overcoming uncertainties generated by the use of new tools and contribute to leading other stakeholders towards the goal: the offset instrument. These mediators call upon effective translation processes to put forward new arguments: a change in spatial and temporal scales and adaptive solutions. The findings point to a line of approach that encourages reconfiguring environmental governance systems that could benefit from feedbacks from Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) processes, in order to facilitate the development of marine offset schemes.

We investigated the effects of riparian forest on invertebrate diversity in coupled stream-riparian networks using a case study in the Zwalm river basin (Flanders, Belgium). Agriculture is one of the main pressures in the basin and riparian forest is limited to a number of isolated patches. Our 32 study sites comprised nine unshaded \""unbuffered\"" sites which were paired with nine shaded \""buffered\"" sites on the same stream reach, along with five 'least-disturbed' sites and nine downstream sites. We sampled water chemistry, habitat characteristics and stream and riparian invertebrates (carabid beetles and spiders) at each site. Three methods were used to quantify riparian attributes at different spatial scales: a visually-assessed qualitative index, quantitative estimates of habitat categories in six rectangular plots (10 x 5 m) and geographic information system (GIS)-derived land cover data. We investigated relationships between invertebrates and riparian attributes at different scales with linear regression and redundancy analyses. Spiders and carabids were most associated with local riparian attributes. In contrast, aquatic macroinvertebrates were strongly influenced by the extent of riparian vegetation in a riparian band upstream (100-300 m). These findings demonstrate the value of quantifying GIS-based metrics of riparian cover over larger spatial scales into assessments of the efficacy of riparian management as a complement to more detailed local scale riparian assessments in situ. Our findings highlight the value of even small patches of riparian vegetation in an otherwise extensively disturbed landscape in supporting biodiversity of both terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates and emphasize the need to consider multiple spatial scales in riparian management strategies which aim to mitigate human impacts on biodiversity in stream-riparian networks."

Here, we use a range of habitat configurations in a model marine benthic system to investigate the effects of species composition, resource heterogeneity and patch connectivity on ecosystem properties at both the patch (bioturbation intensity) and multi-patch (nutrient concentration) scale. We show that allowing fauna to move and preferentially select patches alters local species composition and density distributions, which has negative effects on ecosystem processes (bioturbation intensity) at the patch scale, but overall positive effects on ecosystem functioning (nutrient concentration) at the multi-patch scale. Our findings provide important evidence that community dynamics alter in response to localized resource heterogeneity and that these small-scale variations in habitat structure influence species contributions to ecosystem properties at larger scales. We conclude that habitat complexity forms an important buffer against disturbance and that contemporary estimates of the level of biodiversity required for maintaining future multi-functional systems may need to be revised.

Much less is known about the trends affecting most invertebrates and other neglected taxa, and it is unclear whether well-studied taxa, such as vertebrates, reflect changes in wider biodiversity. Here, we present and analyse trends in the UK distributions of over 5,000 species of invertebrates, bryophytes and lichens, measured as changes in occupancy. Our results reveal substantial variation in the magnitude, direction and timing of changes over the last 45 years. Just one of the four major groups analysed, terrestrial non-insect invertebrates, exhibits the declining trend reported among vertebrates and butterflies. Both terrestrial insects and the bryophytes and lichens group increased in average occupancy. A striking pattern is found among freshwater species, which have undergone a strong recovery since the mid-1990s after two decades of decline. We show that, while average occupancy among most groups appears to have been stable or increasing, there has been substantial change in the relative commonness and rarity of individual species, indicating considerable turnover in community composition. Additionally, large numbers of species have experienced substantial declines. Our results suggest a more complex pattern of biodiversity change in the United Kingdom than previously reported. By analysing changes in occupancy among >5,000 species of invertebrates, bryophytes and lichens in the United Kingdom over the past 45 years, the authors find substantial turnover in community composition among all groups, although average declines are evident only among terrestrial non-insect invertebrates.

The aim in combining the two techniques represents an attempt to overcome some of the inherent differences of scale and resolution which characterize different types of fossil species data. The: two lines of ecofactual evidence, pollen and beetle remains indicate changes in the biodiversity of the floodplain, both in terms of the diversity and abundance of individual species, habitats and ecosystem structure. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of this approach in tracing the decline in plant and entomofaunal diversity at the floodplain forest margin. Although there are recognized limitations imposed by taphonomic uncertainties, taxonomic resolution and restricted ecological data, the combined results provide added details of variations in both species composition and structural diversity within the landscape. The results emphasize the need for multidisciplinary research design in palaeoecological investigations of biodiversity.

Conclusions that are derived from studies in non-mountainous areas are not suitable for predicting the effects of land-use changes on tropical mountains because the climatic environment rapidly changes with elevation, which may mitigate or amplify the effects of land use(4,5). It is of key importance to understand how the interplay of climate and land use constrains biodiversity and ecosystem functions to determine the consequences of global change for mountain ecosystems. Here we show that the interacting effects of climate and land use reshape elevational trends in biodiversity and ecosystem functions on Africa's largest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania). We find that increasing land-use intensity causes larger losses of plant and animal species richness in the arid lowlands than in humid submontane and montane zones. Increases in land-use intensity are associated with significant changes in the composition of plant, animal and microorganism communities; stronger modifications of plant and animal communities occur in arid and humid ecosystems, respectively. Temperature, precipitation and land use jointly modulate soil properties, nutrient turnover, greenhouse gas emissions, plant biomass and productivity, as well as animal interactions. Our data suggest that the response of ecosystem functions to land-use intensity depends strongly on climate; more-severe changes in ecosystem functioning occur in the arid lowlands and the cold montane zone. Interactions between climate and land use explained-on average-54% of the variation in species richness, species composition and ecosystem functions, whereas only 30% of variation was related to single drivers. Our study reveals that climate can modulate the effects of land use on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and points to a lowered resistance of ecosystems in climatically challenging environments to ongoing land-use changes in tropical mountainous regions.

Where efforts to achieve sustainable groundwater management require reductions in aggregate extraction, some of these reductions will entail a decline in agricultural production. However, the degree to which water conservation and other environmental priorities conflict with agricultural production depends, in part, on the spatial configuration of land-use decisions. We explore how to spatially configure groundwater recharge projects to achieve groundwater recharge targets and preserve ecologically important habitat at the least cost. We conduct a field-level analysis for all fields in Kern County, California, the largest crop-producing county in California (and the United States). Results demonstrate that fields selected for cost-effective land retirement can achieve groundwater recharge targets and simultaneously contribute to biodiversity goals via endangered species habitat conservation. However, increasing the amount of habitat conserved raises costs significantly. We discuss conservation actions, economic incentives, and policies that can be leveraged to meet regional biodiversity goals while preserving the economic vitality of agricultural communities. More broadly, this work also provides a proof-of-concept for applying the conservation planning tool, Marxan, to promote efficient allocation of land uses in the face of increasing water resource scarcity and biodiversity threats.

This basic relationship has led to significant increases in our understanding of the internal regulation processes of aquatic communities. However, most of our understanding of the patterns of community size structure is derived from large aquatic systems with little known about the dynamics of small lakes. Processes that promote predictable, or deterministic, community size structure likely differ with levels of biodiversity and disturbance patterns, both of which frequently co-vary with ecosystem size. Here we examine the influence of lake size, fish species richness, and natural disturbance regime on fish community size structure in six small lakes (<200 ha) on Beaver Island, Michigan, USA. Fish communities in three of the six lakes exhibited a deterministic size structure and it appears that disturbance regime is the most obvious barrier to developing and/or maintaining stable and predictable community size structure. In this study, lakes with less than 10 species and lakes experiencing periodic winterkills exhibited stochastic size structure. Lake size did not show any clear relation to fish community size structure. Collectively our results shed some light on the conditions that promote (or do not promote) deterministic size structure.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are key regulators of ecosystem processes, yet how their biodiversity works in ecosystems remains poorly understood. 2. We documented the extent to which taxonomic resolution influenced the effect of biodiversity of AMF taxa on plant performance (growth, nutrient uptake and stress tolerance) in a meta-analysis of 902 articles. 3. We found that the effect of biodiversity of AMF taxa depended on taxonomic resolution. Plant performance was positively promoted by AMF family richness, while no effect was found for fungal species richness. In addition, negative effect was found between AMF phylogenetic diversity and plant growth. This pattern can be explained by functional conservatism within AMF families and functional differentiation among AMF families. 4. Synthesis. Conservation of AMF communities to maintain a full complement of ecosystem functions requires the presence of diverse families and not simply diverse species within a family. This finding may be of key importance for the function of ecosystems under various environmental perturbations to which AMF families may respond differently.

The structural feature is the Brazilian land-tenure system, whereas the macroeconomic factors are chronic inflation, and the trade and the foreign debt of Brazil. We show that deforestation is due to circular causation; inflation leads to deforestation and land enclosures, which lead to the expulsion of peasants from the enclosed lands, with further deforestation. Furthermore, Brazilian international trade follows the demand patterns established by world markets, which put added pressures on the forests. We also argue that the extractive reserves and other extractive-based solutions are not viable in the long run. Finally, we show that the Convention on Biological Diversify is necessary but not sufficient to ensure sustainable use of Amazon biological resources.

To safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services, designating protected areas is crucial; yet the extent to which the existing placement of protection is aligned to meet these conservation priorities is questionable, especially in the oceans. Here we investigate and compare global patterns of multiple biodiversity components (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional), ecosystem services and human impacts, with the coverage of marine protected areas across a nested spatial scale. We demonstrate a pronounced spatial mismatch between the existing degree of protection and all the conservation priorities above, highlighting that neither the world's most diverse, nor the most productive ecosystems are currently the most protected ecosystems. Furthermore, we show that global patterns of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human impacts are poorly correlated, hence complicating the identification of generally applicable spatial prioritization schemes. However, a hypothetical \""consensus approach\"" would have been able to address all these conservation priorities far more effectively than the existing degree of protection, which at best is only marginally better than a random expectation. Therefore, a holistic perspective is needed when designating an appropriate degree of protection of marine conservation priorities worldwide."

Despite their crucial ecological role, we know little about how soils react to more than two environmental factors at a time. Here, we show experimentally that increasing the number of simultaneous global change factors (up to 10) caused increasing directional changes in soil properties, soil processes, and microbial communities, though there was greater uncertainty in predicting the magnitude of change. Our study provides a blueprint for addressing multifactor change with an efficient, broadly applicable experimental design for studying the impacts of global environmental change.

Here we investigated the applicability of ecological niche modeling for endangered relic shrubs to detect areas of priority for biodiversity conservation and analyze differences in ecological niche spaces used by relic shrubs. We applied ordination and niche modeling techniques to assess main environmental drivers of five endemic relic shrubs in western Ordos, namely, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Amygdalus mongolica, Helianthemum songaricum, Potaninia mongolica, and Tetraena mongolica. We calculated niche overlap metrics in gridded environmental spaces and compared geographical projections of ecological niches to determine similarities and differences of niches occupied by relic shrubs. All studied taxa presented different responses to environmental factors, which resulted in a unique combination of niche conditions. Precipitation availability and soil quality characteristics play important roles in the distributions of most shrubs. Each relic shrub is constrained by a unique set of environmental conditions, the distribution of one species cannot be implied by the distribution of another, highlighting the inadequacy of one-fits-all type of conservation measure. Our stacked habitat suitability maps revealed regions around Yellow River, which are highly suitable for most species, thereby providing high conservation value.

However, there are subtle but crucial differences among the approaches by several of these authors. This poses a major obstacle for anyone interested in applying the methodology of MaxEnt in this context. In a recent publication, Frank (2011) gives some arguments why his own approach would represent an improvement as compared to the earlier paper by Pueyo et al. (2007) and also to the views by Edwin T. Jaynes, who first formulated MaxEnt in the context of statistical physics. Here I show that his criticisms are flawed and that there are fundamental reasons to prefer the original approach.

Yet, the potential of co-management arrangements can fail to be realized when there is insufficient local engagement. In this perspective paper, we argue that co-management schemes focusing on culturally important species (CIS) can help overcome this issue by engaging local people's interest. To develop this theory, we explore published data on the outcomes of two management schemes, both encompassing multiple independent initiatives, to discuss CIS-management effects and benefits. We also show a compilation of CIS examples throughout the world and discuss the potential of CIS-management to reach a global audience. Based on these data, we argue that CIS-management can be an effective tool to reconcile the often intractable goals of biodiversity conservation and human welfare.	de Freitas, Carolina Tavares ; Macedo Lopes, Priscila F. ; Campos-Silva, Joao Vitor ; Noble, Mae M. ; Dyball, Robert ; Peres, Carlos A.	6	43424767 ; 1001309 ; 9780578 ; 2821992 ; 5283690 ; 42034558	Brazil ; Brazil ; Australia ; England	amazon ; arapaima spp ; collaborative management ; cultural keystone species ; culturally significant species ; podocnemis spp ; resource use ; traditional people	2020	Paolo Domenici	yes	Neotropical	Brazilian Amazon	NA	Freshwater	freshwater ecosystems	Big data	0	0	NA	biodiversity conservation	0	0	0	Arapaima spp. and Podocnemis spp.	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA

Here we present a continuous, first-of-its-kind 1.3-My record of continental hydroclimate and lake-level variability derived from drill core data from Lake Malawi, East Africa (9-15 degrees S). Over the Quaternary, we observe dramatic shifts in effective moisture, resulting in large-scale changes in one of the world's largest lakes and most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Results show evidence for 24 lake level drops of more than 200 m during the Late Quaternary, including 15 lowstands when water levels were more than 400 m lower than modern. A dramatic shift is observed at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), consistent with far-field climate forcing, which separates vastly different hydroclimate regimes before and after similar to 800,000 years ago. Before 800 ka, lake levels were lower, indicating a climate drier than today, and water levels changed frequently. Following the MPT high-amplitude lake level variations dominate the record. From 800 to 100 ka, a deep, often overfilled lake occupied the basin, indicating a wetter climate, but these highstands were interrupted by prolonged intervals of extreme drought. Periods of high lake level are observed during times of high eccentricity. The extreme hydroclimate variability exerted a profound influence on the Lake Malawi endemic cichlid fish species flock; the geographically extensive habitat reconfiguration provided novel ecological opportunities, enabling new populations to differentiate rapidly to distinct species.

9334	WOS:000367411200087	Mapping biodiversity in three-dimensions challenges marine conservation strategies: The example of coralligenous assemblages in North-Western Mediterranean Sea	Ecological Indicators	02/01/2016	10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.10.062	20	Multi-facet diversity indices have been increasingly widely used in conservation ecology but congruence analyses both on horizontal and vertical axes have not yet been explored. We investigated the vertical and horizontal distributions of alpha and beta taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) in a three-dimensional structured ecosystem. We focused on the Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages which form complex structures both vertically and horizontally, and are considered as the most diverse and threatened communities of the Mediterranean Sea. Although comparable to tropical reef assemblages in terms of richness, biomass and production, coralligenous assemblages are less known and more rarely studied, in particular because of their location in deep waters. Our study covers the entire range of distribution of coralligenous habitats along the French Mediterranean coasts, representing the most complete database so far developed for this important ecosystem. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of spatial diversity patterns of marine biodiversity on both horizontal and vertical scales. Our study revealed that taxonomic diversity differed from functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns at the station level, the latter two being strongly structured by depth, with shallower stations generally richer than deeper ones. Considering all stations, phylogenetic diversity was less congruent to taxonomic diversity (Pearson's correlation of r= 0.48) but more congruent to functional diversity (r=0.69) than randomly expected. Similar congruence patterns were revealed for stations deeper than 50 m.(r= 0.44 and r= 0.84, respectively) but no significantly different congruence level than randomly expected was revealed among diversity facets for more shallow stations. Mean functional alpha- and alpha-diversity were lower than phylogenetic diversity and even lower than taxonomic alpha- and beta-diversity for both vertical and horizontal scales. Low FD and PD values at both alpha- and beta-diversity indicated functional and phylogenetic clustering. Community dissimilarities (beta-diversity) increased over depth especially in central and eastern part of the French Mediterranean littoral and in northern Corsica, indicating coralligenous vertical structure within these regions. Overall horizontal beta-diversity was higher within the 50-70 m depth belts. We conclude that taxonomic diversity alone is inadequate as a basis for setting conservation goals for this ecosystem and additional information, at least on phylogenetic diversity, is needed to preserve the ecosystem functioning and coralligenous evolutionary history. Our results highlight the necessity of considering different depth belts as a basis for regional scale conservation efforts. Current conservation approaches, such as the existing marine protected areas, are insufficient in preserving coralligenous habitats. The use of multi-facet indices should be considered, focusing on preserving local diversity patterns and compositional dissimilarities, both vertically and horizontally. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The South American Dry Chaco contains some of the fastest expanding agricultural frontiers worldwide, and includes diverse forms of land management, mainly associated with different land tenure regimes; which in turn are segregated along environmental gradients (mostly rainfall). Yet, how these regimes impact the environment and how trade-offs between production and environmental outcomes varies remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed how biodiversity, biomass stocks, and agricultural production, measured in meat-equivalents, differ among land tenure regimes in the Dry Chaco. We calculated a land-use outcome index (LUO) that combines indices comparing actual vs. potential values of `preservation of biodiversity' (PI), ` standing biomass' (BI) and ` meat production' (MI). We found land-use outcomes to vary substantially among land-tenure regimes. Protected areas showed a biodiversity index of 0.75, similar to that of large and medium-sized farms (0.72 in both farming systems), and higher than in the other tenure regimes. Biomass index was similar among land tenure regimes, whereas we found the highest median meat production index on indigenous lands (MI = 0.35). Land-use outcomes, however, varied more across different environmental conditions than across land tenure regimes. Our results suggest that in the Argentine Dry Chaco, there is no single land tenure regime that better minimizes the trade-offs between production and environmental outcomes. A useful approach to manage these trade-offs would be to develop geographically explicit guidelines for land-use zoning, identifying the land tenure regimes more appropriate for each zone.

The same two hotspots could be recognized at all scales, although details differed. Differences in sampling intensity were not sufficient to explain these patterns. Correlations between number of species and number of sampled localities increased with increasing cell size. Additional species are expected to be found in the region, as indicated by jackknife 1, jackknife 2, Chao2, bootstrap, and incidence-based coverage (ICE) species richness estimators. All estimates increased with increasing cell size, except Chao2, with the lowest prediction at the intermediate 20 x 20 km cell size. Jackknife 2 and ICE gave highest estimates and jackknife 1 and bootstrap the lowest. Jackknife 1 and bootstrap estimates changed least with cell size, while the number of single cell species increased. In the highly endemic subterranean fauna with many rare species, bootstrap may be most appropriate to consider. Positive autocorrelation of species numbers was highest at 20 x 20 km scale, so we used this cell size for further analyses. At this scale we added 137 localities with less positional accuracy to 1572 previously considered, and increased 254 troglobiotic species considered to 276. Previously discovered hotspots and their positions did not change, except for a new species-rich cell which appeared in the south-eastern region. There are two centres of troglobiotic species richness in the Dinaric karst. The one in the north-west exhibited high species richness of Trechinae (Carabidae), while in the south-east, the Leptodirinae (Cholevidae) were much more diverse. These centres of species richness should serve as the starting point for establishing a conservation network of important subterranean areas in Dinaric karst.

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur. This finding could help to inform the development of the post-2020 biodiversity framework, by highlighting the under-studied regions where biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest. Analysing responses of biodiversity to changes in land use and climate across global ecoregions, the authors identify strong negative responses in both tropical and Mediterranean biomes, driven primarily by low climatic seasonality and the history of human disturbance.

Previous culture-independent studies demonstrated that similar to15% of all Bacillus 16S rDNA directly extracted from soils worldwide was affiliated to B. niacini. Seven different media were inoculated with soil suspensions in serial dilutions and incubated at different temperatures. Then, bacterial colonies were picked and analyzed by sequencing. A mineral medium with acetate as carbon source yielded a B. niacini rate of >3% of all picked colonies. Other media were less efficient but also successful. Applying this culturing approach, we succeeded in obtaining 64 isolates from different Dutch soils. The isolates turned out to be diverse, although closely related to B. niacini as revealed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Close matches with environmental clones were also found, thus demonstrating much more diversity beyond previously known 16S rDNA sequences. The rep-PCR fingerprinting method revealed a high genomic variety, redundancy could not be observed among our isolates. Hence, the hitherto neglected B. niacini lineage, apparently among the most abundant soil Bacillus, was accessible to our cultivation approach.

The diversity of source (glacier-fed [GF], snow-fed [SN] and spring-fed [SF]) and stream-size (both interrelated) across the altitudinal panorama, create numerous habitats that contribute to structural diversity. The spatial patterns in richness, density and taxonomic composition and distribution of benthic diatoms are less affected by source compared with macro-invertebrates but shows strong influence on the distribution of fish fauna that are poikiliotherms, because a glacier-fed river carries ice-cold water (usually <20 degrees C) in contrast to normal waters in spring-fed system (22 degrees C near snowline, 32 degrees C in foothills). The abundance patterns of biota of lower organisation grade (diatoms, macro-invertebrates) do not differ sharply even across distant river basins as they are more influenced by proximate factors; thus the sub-basins of the Alaknanda resemble more by virtue of one basin and there is notable resemblance between distant SF Bemunda (lower Ganga basin) and SF Gomti (East Rmgang basin) and even the farthest Yamuna and Rmgang. Fish are more sensitive to temperature and current velocities that are related to altitude and hence longitudinal rather than the spatial gradients in the mountains. The lotic ecosystem of Doon Valley harbour rich and diverse diatom flora, macroinvertebrate fauna and ichthyofauna. The examination of trophic, saprobic and ecological status shows that organic pollution, degradation and anthropogenic eutrophication are non-existent in the Lesser Himalayan rivers and streams, but the fragile Doon Valley is under severe anthropogenic stress. This and habitats fragmented by hydropower projects in the major rivers has threatened the iconic game fish Himalayan mahseer in the Ganga.

1361	WOS:000270849400008	A Long-term Perspective on Biodiversity and Marine Resource Exploitation in Fiji's Lau Group	Pacific Science	01/10/2009	NA	18	I present research investigating biodiversity and human interaction with the local environment through three perspectives on diverse islands in Fiji's Lau Group. First, I generated long-term data on marine diversity and exploitation through zooarchaeological analyses of fauna from sites spanning the region's prehistoric human occupation. The study areas are representative of regional fauna and local geographic variation in island size and structure. Each island also varies in terms of human occupation and degree of impacts on marine and terrestrial environments. Second, my ethnographic work recorded modern marine exploitation patterns by Lauan communities. Third, marine biological surveys documented living faunas. Together this information is used to explore the marine environment over the three millennia of human occupation. Using data derived from my multipronged study I discuss potential causes of ecological change in this tropical marine setting. My, findings include the following: (1) data indicate that relative intensity of human Occupation and exploitation determines modern composition and biological diversity of marine communities because human disturbance occurred more extensively on larger islands than on smaller islands in Lau; (2) Lauans appear to have targeted similar suites of marine fauna across their 3,000 years of history on these islands; (3) Lauans have had a selective effect on marine biodiversity because particular species are/were targeted according to local standards of ranking and preference; (4) marine resources existing today have withstood over 3,000 years of human impacts and therefore may have life history traits supporting resilience and making conservation efforts worthwhile.

In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffets and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of ""best management practices"" (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help. conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival."

Moreover, it could be valuable to know what additional threats may arise from continued human population growth. Here we quantify a model of the relationship between human population density and the number of threatened mammal and bird species by nation. Our multiple regression analysis revealed that two predictor variables, human population density and species richness (of birds and mammals), account for 88% of the variability in log-transformed densities of threatened species across 114 continental nations. Using the regression model with projected population sizes of each nation, we found that the number of threatened species in the average nation is expected to increase 7% by 2020, and 14% by 2050, as forecast by human population growth alone. Our findings strongly support the notion that abating human population growth is a necessary, if not sufficient, step in the epic attempt to conserve biodiversity on the global scale.

Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Taita Hills Cloud Forest (THCF) in Kenya remains one of the top biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Environmental data for the area has been studied for decades. Sociodemographic analyses on inequality have been conducted by governmental and non-governmental organizations. Little has been done yet to correlate them to investigate their relationships. A lot of attention has been paid to the connection between agricultural practices and impacts on the environment, but human-environment relationships are much more complex, especially in Kenya's biodiversity-rich areas. This paper assesses the local population's perception of its surrounding environment and investigates their understanding of nature conservation. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, 300 survey respondents were classified concerning their nature ethical views (particularly anthropocentrism and ecocentrism). By using grounded theory, data were regularly reviewed during the entire research, to assemble an evaluable and comparable dataset. Our study reveals that gender has a distinct impact on whether the interviewees have an anthropocentric or ecocentric perspective of nature and conservation. Moreover, there is a strong need for an intermediate bridge between anthropocentrism and ecocentrism.

On the basis of the detailed characteristic of the ecological conditions the data for distribution of the natural vegetation in different thermo-climate belts are presented and in accordance with these data our country has the following belts: alpine, sub-alpine, high-mountain, middle-mountain, and low-mountain and zonal afore-mountain belt. The forest growing zones are differentiated in Zone of Pinus mugo, Zone of Picea abies and Pinus peuce, Zone of Fagus sylvatica and conifers, Zone of Quercus species. There are three forest-growing belts, respectively high-mountain forest-growing belt, middle mountain belt of beech and coniferous forests, where the beech forests are widespread, lower plain-hilled and hill-fore-mountain belt of oak forests and each have three sub-belts. This study shows actual information for the distribution and natural renovation of the main forest types in Bulgaria. There are indicated the basic forest trees, forming the structure of the natural forest ecosystems according altitude and soil-climatic conditions. In the structure of the natural forests the species Picea abies (L.) K a r s t., Pinus sylvestris L., Abies alba M i I I., Fagus sylvatica L., Carpinus betulus L., Quercus petraea L i e b L, Quercus cerris L., Quercus pubescens W i I I d. and in rare occasions Quercus robur L., Quercus coccifera L., Quercus hartwissiana S t e v. with their companion species prevail from the high to the lower parts of the country.

Traditional hypotheses that account for such exceptional biodiversity have highlighted the importance of environmental variables such as habitat area and energy input. Recently, however, an additional explanation has been proposed based on geometric constraints in the placement of geographical ranges within a bounded domain, which cause a mid-domain peak in species richness; the mid-domain effect (MDE). Here, for the first time, we examine the relative importance of area, energy and MDE jointly on species richness patterns. Model selection indicates that the best model incorporates MDE and reef area, but no energy effect; moreover, this best-fit model captures all major features of reef fish and coral species richness patterns. Habitat area is the major environmental factor influencing species richness. The prevention of further fragmentation and loss of habitat area is of critical importance for the conservation of coral reef biodiversity.

4687	WOS:000179624600005	Irreversible impact of past land use on forest soils and biodiversity	Ecology	01/11/2002	NA	469	In western Europe, forest area has been expanding rapidly since the 19th century, mainly on former agricultural land. Previous studies show that plant diversity differs between these recent forests and ancient forests that were already forested at the time of first national cadastral surveys, around 1800. Here, we investigated the duration of such agricultural aftereffects. In northeastern France, large areas were deforested during the Roman occupation and thereafter abandoned to forest. In one such forest that was farmed during the period AD 50-250, we show that species richness and plant communities vary according to the intensity of former agriculture. These variations are linked to long-erm changes of chemical and structural soil properties. Hence, we suggest that such effects of past agricultural land use on forest biodiversity may be irreversible on an historical time scale.

DNA barcoding is well established in animals, but there is not yet any universally accepted barcode for plants. Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using >1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a ""DNA barcoding gap"" is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing > 1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes."

Effects of forest conversion on stream beta diversity are much harder to predict, both because empirical studies are few and because competing theories suggest opposite responses. Moreover, almost no data exist for tropical Africa, a region that is paradoxically a hotspot of both current deforestation and freshwater biodiversity. Here, we compared environmental variables, invertebrate community composition, and alpha and beta diversity of forested and deforested (agricultural) streams in and around Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found that forest conversion strongly influenced stream environmental variables and invertebrate community composition, and that agricultural land use reduced stream alpha diversity. However, among-stream beta diversity was greater across the agricultural landscape than inside the forest. Decomposing beta diversity into taxa replacement and richness differences demonstrated that replacement contributed a similar proportion to total beta diversity in both land use classes.

Given the diversity of ecological, political, and socio-economic systems where offsets may be applied, place-based information is likely to be most useful in designing and implementing offset programs, along with guiding principles that assure best practice. We reviewed the research on biodiversity offsets to explore gaps and needs. While the peer-reviewed literature on offsets is growing rapidly, it is heavily dominated by ecological theory, wetland ecosystems, and U.S.- based research. Given that majority of offset policies and programs are occurring in middle-and low-income countries, the research gaps we identified present a number of risks. They also present an opportunity to create regionally based learning platforms focused on pilot projects and institutional capacity building. Scientific research should diversify, both topically and geographically, in order to support the successful design, implementation, and monitoring of biodiversity offset programs.

Consequently, a number of areas considered important for the conservation of these birds are currently protected by EU legislation. The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), conceived to increase agricultural production, has no restrictions in these protected areas, which creates a conflict between current agricultural policy and legislation on biodiversity conservation. Long-term monitoring of flagship bird species in a Mediterranean protected area shows significant population declines. Similar declines also affect common farmland bird species in others agricultural protected areas, confirming a failure of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. If Europeans want to conserve these landscapes and their biodiversity, the present conservation model should change in farmland areas. Solutions must involve the prohibition of agricultural intensification, and the implementation of sustainable farming practices different from current CAP subsidies.

7224	WOS:000272193300003	A cross-taxonomic index for quantifying the health of farmland biodiversity	Journal of Applied Ecology	01/12/2009	10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01709.x	40	P>1. The development of sustainable, multi-functional agricultural systems involves reconciling the needs of agricultural production with the objectives for environmental protection, including biodiversity conservation. However, the definition of sustainability remains ambiguous and it has proven difficult to identify suitable indicators for monitoring progress towards, and the successful achievement of, sustainability. 2. In this study, we show that a trait-based approach can be used to assess the detrimental impacts of agricultural change to a broad range of taxonomic groupings and derive a standardised index of farmland biodiversity health, built around an objective of achieving stable or increasing populations in all species associated with agricultural landscapes. 3. To demonstrate its application, we assess the health of UK farmland biodiversity relative to this goal. Our results suggest that the populations of two-thirds of 333 plant and animal species assessed are unsustainable under current UK agricultural practices. 4. We then explore the potential benefits of an agri-environment scheme, Entry Level Stewardship (ELS), to farmland biodiversity in the UK under differing levels of risk mitigation delivery. We show that ELS has the potential to make a significant contribution to progress towards sustainability targets but that this potential is severely restricted by current patterns of scheme deployment. 5.Synthesis and applications: We have developed a cross-taxonomic sustainability index which can be used to assess both the current health of farmland biodiversity and the impacts of future agricultural changes relative to quantitative biodiversity targets. Although biodiversity conservation is just one of a number of factors that must be considered when defining sustainability, we believe our cross-taxonomic index has the potential to be a valuable tool for guiding the development of sustainable agricultural systems.

In the past, such activities were funded and managed by the public sector; however, in recent years, public support has declined and this has spawned a growing interest in conservation opportunities that might arise from 'free-market' approaches to sustainable land use and management. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is the key framework for articulating policies and actions on biodiversity; however, progress in developing suitable economic and market incentives for biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use has been slow, with activities such as bioprospecting and ecotourism making some, albeit limited, headway. Given the United Nations Framework for Climate Change or United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) high profile within the public and private sectors, there is some potential for using it to help advance CBD objectives and provide the much-needed economic incentives for conservation, through some of the market-based mechanisms presented under the Kyoto Protocol. Significant potential lies in the fact that many 'natural' forests and certain other ecosystems are both major stores of carbon and areas of valuable biodiversity. Thus, any attempt at conserving these areas has the potential to yield both carbon and biodiversity benefits. So far, however, the conservation of natural forests is not included in the Kyoto Protocol's definition of sinks. Instead the creation of sinks-through the establishment of fast-growing monocultures-may well lead to biodiversity losses, especially if partly degraded lands axe cleared for this purpose. If real progress is to be made, our understanding of the relationship between land use and biodiversity benefits needs to be improved, and more appropriate proxies for biodiversity need to be developed. At the same time, we need to have a clear understanding of the precise nature of the potential synergies and be more able to identify possible jointaction opportunities that exist between the UNFCCC, the CBD and the Convention on Combating Desertification and other international trade and economic agreements.

Water Research	01/01/2012	10.1016/j.watres.2011.10.053	35	Biodiversity recovery measures have often been ignored when dealing with the restoration of degraded aquatic systems. Furthermore, biological valuation methods have been applied only spatially in previous studies, and not jointly on a temporal and spatial scale. The intense monitoring efforts carried out in a highly polluted estuary, in northern Spain (Nervion estuary), allowed for the economic valuation of the costs and the biological valuation of the benefits associated with a 21 years sewage scheme application. The analysis show that the total amount of money invested into the sewage scheme has contributed to the estuary's improvement of both environmental and biological features, as well as to an increase in the uses and services provided by the estuary. However, the inner and outer parts of the estuary showed different responses. An understanding of the costs and trajectories of the environmental recovery of degraded aquatic systems is increasingly necessary to allow policy makers and regulators to formulate robust, cost-efficient and feasible management decisions.

From these predicted distributions, an index of plant species richness was generated for the forest area. The most common predictors for distribution were found to be climatic surfaces incorporating some aspect of seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Although coarse, the index confirmed existing knowledge of areas of high biodiversity within the study area and introduced a new area, the Blackwood Plateau, for consideration as a conservation reserve with high species richness. An additional survey was conducted to sample actual species richness in 11 test sites. When actual richness was regressed against predicted richness, a significant correlation was obtained if both annuals and geophytes were excluded from the analysis. With refinement of the model and further data collection targeted at areas of low effort, the species richness index is proposed as a useful tool for conservation planning.

637	WOS:000232322600021	Reconciling methodologically different biodiversity assessments	Ecological Applications	10/01/2005	NA	18	"Ongoing large-scale habitat disturbance requires quick identification of conservation priorities such as targeting sites rich in species and/or endemics. Biodiversity assessments are time consuming and expensive, so surveys often rely on partial sampling. Optimal use should be made of all currently available sources of information, but methodological differences between surveys hamper direct comparison. Because diversity depends on spatial scale, diversity characteristics of different sites are best compared on the basis of species-area relationships. As a result of the incompleteness of sampling, the observed species-area relationship deviates from the \""true\"" species-area relationship. In this paper, we identify five key factors affecting the shape of the species-area relationship due to incomplete sampling: (1) the total spatial extent of the observations, (2) the spatial distribution of the observations, (3) the proportion of the total extent sampled, (4) the proportion of the individuals in the sampled area included in the survey, and (5) the proportion of the included individuals successfully identified. We outline how methodologically different surveys can be combined to optimize the use of existing data in the evaluation of conservation needs, particularly for tropical forests. As an illustration, we analyzed four methodologically different botanical surveys in the same area of old growth lowland forest in South Cameroon with the aim of reconciling these surveys. The four surveys were (1) reconnaissance scale vegetation mapping, (2) detailed botanical assessment (all individuals), (3) incomplete botanical assessment (10% individuals), and (4) herbarium collections. By correcting for the five key factors we were able to match the results of the four different biodiversity surveys. The five key factors affected the recorded number of species and endemics differently; partial sampling of extent (3) and individuals (4) and partial identification of individuals (5) were the three most important factors. We conclude that reconciliation of biodiversity assessments is possible if the differences between methods can be accounted for. We advocate reliable documentation of survey methods, especially the five key factors, because it greatly enhances the potential of combining methodologically different surveys for comparative biodiversity analyses."

788	WOS:000233509600012	PLOCH: a standardized method for sampling and assessing the biodiversity in ponds	Aquatic Conservation-Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems	11/01/2005	10.1002/aqc.744	71	1. As ponds are now recognized as freshwater habitats clearly distinct from lakes and running waters. there is a need for standardized tools for assessing their ecological integrity and status, and particularly their biodiversity. 2. A standardized method was developed for sampling and assessing the species richness of ponds. Experiences accumulated in previous studies, together with data gathered from 80 Swiss ponds, provided the basis of the proposed method. 3. Five taxonomic groups were chosen as complementary representatives of pond inhabitants: aquatic plants, aquatic Gastropoda, aquatic Coleoptera, adult Odonata and Amphibia. 4. To sample aquatic flora, quadrats are located along transects perpendicular to the longest axis of the pond. The number of quadrats is calculated from a relationship with pond area. A nonparametric estimator (Jackknife-1) is used to estimate the true species richness from the observed richness. 5. Aquatic invertebrates (Gastropoda, Coleoptera) are collected with a hand net. Sampling is stratified within the dominant habitats. The number of samples is calculated from a relationship with pond area. As with the Vegetation, the Jackknife-1 estimator is used to estimate the true species richness. 6. The species richness of adult Odonata is assessed using a standardized field survey method combining observations from early and late summer. The species richness is corrected with an abundance-based estimator (Chao1). The species richness of Amphibia is obtained from an exhaustive inventory. 7. For the assessment of biodiversity, species richness values derived from measurements are compared to values predicted for conditions that enable a high species richness. Generalized Additive Models are used to predict species richness from environmental predictors characterizing the pond. The ratio of measured richness to predicted richness allows the allocation of a quality status to each pond. Results are divided into five biological quality classes, as recommended in the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Method description and examples of application"	Limnetica	06/01/2010	NA	18	"Ponds are now widely recognized to contribute significantly to regional freshwater biodiversity. Therefore, tools to easily and rapidly assess biological quality specifically for these aquatic habitats have been increasingly requested by conservation planners and nature managers. In close association with practitioners, we developed such a method for Switzerland; the pond biodiversity index \""IBEM\"". The IBEM-Index is based on the assessment of the taxonomic richness of 5 groups: aquatic vegetation, Gastropoda. Coleoptera, adult Odonata and Amphibia. No abundance data are necessary and genus level identification is required for all groups except Amphibia (species level). The sampling methodology is a stratified random strategy and allows the use of richness estimators to transform the observed taxonomic richness (S-obs) into true taxonomic richness (S-true). As the IBEM assessment follows the methodology presented in the Water Framework Directive, it is based on the calculation of the ratio of true taxonomic richness (S-true) to reference-based predicted richness (S-ref). Each of the five taxonomic groups is assessed separately and the overall biological quality of any given pond (i.e. the IBEM-Index) is the average of the five ratios. This score is later converted into one of five quality classes for each pond: bad (0 to 0.2), poor (>0.2 to 0.4), moderate (>0.4 to 0.6), good (>0.6 to 0.8), and high (>0.8 to 1). In this paper, the implementation of the IBEM-Index is described in detail. The sampling methodologies are developed (for the biodiversity and the environmental variables) as well as the assessment methodology. Finally, two examples are presented in detail, for a \""good\"" quality pond and for a \""bad\"" quality pond. The method implementation also includes a website (http://campus.hesge.ch/ibem) which allows the online calculation of the index, and provides support for both sampling and assessment methodologies to users. The IBEM-Index is a rapid assessment method which gives an overall value of pond biodiversity in terms of taxa richness and can be used, for example, in regional screenings or site monitoring in Switzerland. Moreover, as biodiversity is generally recognized as a good indicator of global ecological quality, the IBEM-Index can also be used to investigate ecosystem quality."

The benthic fauna of this region accounts for more than 1600 species showing marked latitudinal biogeographic differences characterizing this as one of the most important hotspot of biodiversity of cold-temperate environments. Despite numerous studies have been conducted to depict the biological characteristics of the fjords, the present situation is strongly unbalanced towards specific taxa. Hence, this study takes into consideration a community approach, highlighting the distribution of six benthic assemblages thriving on vertical walls along the Seno Magdalena fjord (Aysen region). Underwater pictures were used to characterize the trends in abundance and diversity of the main taxa showing distinct responses to salinity and turbidity. Among the less tolerant taxa to high fresh water inputs there are encrusting algae, mainly found in the most external sites lashed by outer currents, far from the estuarine plume. The bathymetric zonation of the assemblages, instead, is characterized by a dense mussel belt in the first 10 m, within a thick layer of low salinity, nutrient-enriched waters. Rich assemblages of sponges, brachiopods, gorgonians and sderactinians thrive in deeper, marine, clear waters. The evaluation of the ecological role of benthic species leads both to the definition of potential bioindicator taxa responding to anthropic disturbances and to the promotion of protected areas.

An analysis of five different coffee production systems in western El Salvador	Ecological Economics	05/01/2000	NA	72	The current trend for reducing shade cover in coffee plantations in northern Latin America has prompted concern among conservationists because of its potential implications for the loss of biodiversity. To help reverse such a trend, a project has been launched to promote biodiversity-friendly cultural practices in coffee plantations and the marketing of certified 'biodiversity-friendly' coffee. This paper examines the financial feasibility of investing in the certification criteria for a 'biodiversity-friendly' coffee in farms with different production systems in western El Salvador. Models were developed to estimate net present values and risks associated with the investment for five hypothetical, but typical, coffee farms: (1) traditional polyculture; (2) commercial polyculture; (3) technified shade less than 1200 m elevation; (4) technified shade greater than 1200 m elevation; and (5) unshaded monoculture. To invest in the 'biodiversity-friendly' certification criteria was financially viable in all farms. The unshaded monoculture farm type was the most profitable case, and the farm under traditional polyculture was the only risk-free. Capital requirements for the investment are low, though they increase as shade cover in the farm becomes reduced. Small, cash-poor farmers will need assistance to make the up-front expenditures required to have the farm certified. Incentives for certified biodiversity-friendly coffee plantations such as tax relief, payment for environmental services, and soft credits could help make the investment more attractive.

This paper describes patterns of fish diversity in remnant freshwater lagoons in relation to natural environmental gradients and impacts of agriculture in the Tully-Murray catchment, Queensland Wet Tropics bioregion (QWT), in north-eastern Australia. Floodplain lagoons supported 21 of 29 native fish species recorded from freshwater habitats of these rivers, including three species not typically found in main river channels or tributaries, and six that require access to saline areas for spawning or larval development. Eight species favoured lagoons during their early life history, highlighting the vital role of these water bodies in providing nursery habitat. Assemblage composition differed with distance from the coast, position on the floodplain, water quality and habitat. Aquatic vegetation discriminated lagoons and habitat patches within lagoons, and fish species richness was lower in patches of exotic ponded-pasture grasses. Although the lagoons are surrounded by intensive agriculture, especially sugarcane plantations, they are in good ecological condition, largely because of retention of some riparian vegetation, and frequent flushing by high stream flows. They offer opportunities to conserve taxonomic and functional biodiversity that is at present poorly protected by terrestrial reserves focused mainly on forested uplands. Of the 21 native species recorded, only one has >20% of its QWT distribution protected in IUCN category II protected areas (National Parks), and nine species have <10% of their QWT distribution in protected areas. Opportunities to protect tropical freshwater fish diversity may be lost if threatening processes are not held in check through maintenance of natural flow regimes and floodplain connectivity, protection of riparian vegetation and aquatic habitat structure, continued application of best management farming practices and off-reserve protection of freshwater habitats on public and private lands.

Environmental Values	02/01/2000	NA	7	This paper attempts to assess and evaluate some of the economic implications of the Convention on Biological Diversity. After outlining the main principles and the scope of this Convention, the following issues are addressed: the determination of the 'optimal' level of biodiversity loss, the meaning of incremental costs, and monetary evaluation problems of ecological resources and the problems it poses for the funding mechanism (GEF). The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues of commercialisation and access to genetic resources.

Biodiversity and Conservation	01/01/2013	10.1007/s10531-012-0401-4	10	Over the last four decades the world has been losing biodiversity at an alarming rate despite the increasing number of protected areas (PAs). Certified forest management may complement the role of PAs in protecting biodiversity. Forest certification aims to promote sustainable forest management and to maintain or enhance the conservation value of certified forests. The area of forest under certified forest management has grown quickly over the past decade. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, for example, currently covers 148 million hectares, i.e., 3.7 % of the world's forests. In spite of such increase there is, however, a dearth of information on how forest certification is related to biodiversity. In this study we assessed if FSC certification is being applied in high biodiversity areas in cork oak savannas in Portugal by comparing biodiversity values of certified and non-certified areas for birds, reptiles and amphibians. We calculated the relative species richness and irreplaceability value for each group of species in certified and non-certified areas and compared them using randomization tests. The biodiversity value of certified areas was not significantly greater than that of non-certified areas. Since FSC certification is expanding quickly in cork oak savannas it is important to consider the biodiversity value of these areas during this process. Prioritizing areas of high biodiversity value would enhance the conservation value of forest certification and facilitate integrating certification with other conservation initiatives.

The island biogeography paradigm therefore needs refining to account for specific responses of taxa to the area of habitat \""islands\"" and to the quality of the surrounding matrix. We incorporated matrix effects into island theory by partitioning the slope (z value) of species-area relationships into two components: gamma, a constant, and sigma, a measure of taxon-specific responses to each component of a heterogeneous matrix. We used our matrix-calibrated model to predict extinction and endangerment of bird species resulting from land-use change in 20 biodiversity hotspots and compared these predictions with observed numbers of extinct and threatened bird species. We repeated this analysis with the conventional species-area model and the countryside species-area model, considering alternative z values of 0.35 (island) or 0.22 (continental). We evaluated the relative strength of support for each of the five candidate models with Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The matrix-calibrated model had the highest AIC weight (w(1) = 89.21%), which means the weight of evidence in support of this model was the optimal model given the set of candidate models and the data. In addition to being a valuable heuristic tool for assessing extinction risk, our matrix-calibrated model also allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity benefits (and trade-offs) of land-management options in human-dominated landscapes. Given that processes of secondary regeneration have become more widespread across tropical regions and are predicted to increase, our matrix-calibrated model will be increasingly appropriate for practical conservation in tropical landscapes."

These environments are considered also as an 'origin place', responsible for the microbial populations located in these plants. Albania is a small country, but with very big differences in the relief and climate, sustaining varieties of plants, including medicinal plants, too. There are actually, completed botanic, medicinal and biotechnological studies of them, but not yet detailed studies about their microflora and other microorganisms originated by the surrounding environments and developed together with epiphyte microorganisms. The genera and species isolated from medicinal plants are originated from natural microflora, the pollution of respective environments and also from microbial strains present in the air and soil of the areas where they are grown. Climatic changes and other natural phenomena are responsible for the presence of different microbial strains. Technical operations in order to use original plants as pharmaceutical preparations, for example the treatments at different temperatures, drying processes or chemical manipulations in order to extract chemical compounds with industrial importance, offer another view of the world of microorganisms present on the surfaces of medicinal plants and/or in their specific biological parts. This study is an introduction of a detailed research work for the isolation, identification and characterisation of the microbial strains, obtained from medicinal plants present in the Mediterranean Albanian environments.

Knowledge of population recovery times post-harvest and dispersal capabilities of native species are critical to the development of spatially-explicit stand management plans that maximise biodiversity opportunities at a landscape scale. To quantify post-harvest recovery patterns we studied the relative capture rates of seven beetle species known to be sensitive to clearfell harvesting. A chronosequence sampling approach was implemented, with sampling along 580-m long edge gradients from the interior of multiple replicated mature stands of 26 years of age into adjacent regenerating stands of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 26 years of age. Beetle capture rates were strongly affected by clearfell harvesting, however, population recovery of all species was possible within the timeframe of a single rotation when adjacent mature or closed-canopy stands were present. Recovery time was closely linked to the development of a closed canopy (8-16 years), with distinct differences in the responses of individual beetle taxa reflecting habitat preferences for open or closed forest. Such time-to-recovery analyses provide insights into temporal aspects of insect-plant-habitat interactions and can give forest managers better guidelines to maximise biodiversity opportunities at the landscape scale. Although the time to canopy closure provides a useful proxy for recolonisation by forest species, specific timeframes will vary biogeographically and are dependent on the original native vegetation context and species assemblages present. In addition, forest managers and public advocacy groups will need to make qualitative decisions about what biodiversity attributes should be conserved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We analysed several well-known 16S rRNA datasets from experimental samples, including both large and short sequences, in numbers of tens of thousands, in addition to carefully crafted synthetic datasets containing more than 7000 OTUs. From this data analysis several patterns were identified and used to develop new guidelines for experimentation in conditions of high biodiversity. We analysed the suitability of different clustering packages for these type of situations, the problem of even sampling, the relative effectiveness of Chao1 and ACE estimators as well as their effect on sampling size for a variety of population distributions. As regards practical analysis procedures, we advocated an approach that retains as much high-quality experimental data as possible. By carefully applying selection rules combining the taxonomic assignment with clustering strategies, we derived a set of recommendations for ultra-sequencing data analysis at high biodiversity levels.

While obtaining a sufficient quantity of DNA for downstream applications is vital for these researchers, it is also important to preserve tissue resources for future use given that the original material is destructively and consumptively sampled with each use. It is therefore necessary to develop standardized tissue subsampling and loaning procedures to ensure that tissues are being used efficiently. In this study, we specifically focus on the efficiency of DNA extraction methods by using anuran liver and muscle tissues maintained at a biodiversity archive. We conducted a series of experiments to test whether current practices involving coarse visual assessments of tissue size are effective, how tissue mass correlates with DNA yield and concentration, and whether the amount of DNA recovered is correlated with sample age. We found that tissue samples between 2 and 8 mg resulted in the most efficient extractions, with tissues at the lower end of this range providing more DNA per unit mass and tissues at the higher end of this range providing more total DNA. Additionally, we found no correlation between tissue age and DNA yield. Because we find that even very small tissue subsamples tend to yield far more DNA than is required by researchers for modern sequencing applications (including whole genome shotgun sequencing), we recommend that biodiversity archives consider dramatically improving sustainable use of their archived material by providing researchers with set quantities of extracted DNA rather than with the subsampled tissues themselves.

This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystern types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.

In a non-linear optimisation procedure, land use is allocated at farm level, taking into account risk behaviour, and spatial as well as temporal variability of net revenues of land-use alternatives, using a spatial resolution of 29 m x 29 m. The model is applied to a study area of 30 km x 34 km in western Ecuador, considered a hotspot for biodiversity. In this coffee growing region, agroforestry systems with shade-coffee are important for biodiversity conservation at the landscape level, but under pressure due to low revenues. Through scenario analyses, we analyse the effects of price premiums per kg, payments per ha, and price buffering for coffee, as well as incentives leading to coffee yield increases, and payments per ha of forest remnants. We compare different risk aversion levels of the involved agents. We conclude that payments per ha are more efficient to maintain or increase coffee areas than payments per kg. Price buffering may be the most cost-effective way to support coffee production, especially at high-risk aversion levels. Significant yield increases are necessary to make coffee more attractive compared to the other alternatives. Relatively low payments per ha of forest can significantly increase forested land. Risk behaviour turns out to be an important factor when determining the possible effect of payments for ecosystem services. We conclude that the model is a versatile tool to support planning of payments for conserving ecosystems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	de Koning, G. H. J. ; Benitez, P.

By combining a structured approach to identifying key drivers of change on biodiversity with a collaborative approach to scenario planning, biodiversity planners and managers can work with stakeholders to identify a range of possible futures and explore their implications. This paper presents an approach to developing scenario narratives constructed against key drivers of change identified through a social-ecological systems analysis. The approach facilitated the integration of stakeholder and expert input to inform system dynamics affecting biodiversity outcomes, helping to direct and discipline the collective imagination, and to challenge assumptions and reveal new opportunities and strategies. Examples are provided to show how conventional notions about preserving biodiversity remnants \""as is\"" were not a good fit for the diverse range of futures imagined, and that restoration ecology would have to expand to incorporate ideas of landscape fluidity and novel ecosystems. Aspects of the scenario narratives highlighted the need for new conservation strategies for the endangered native grassland ecological community within the Tasmanian Midlands case study, and a re-focusing on new locations across that landscape.

However, recent institutional and vertebrate conservation scientists' publication data suggest that China has a growing conservation research capacity deficit. China lacks a pipeline for the training and development of conservation scientists locally and abroad. The network of active conservation scientists is rapidly shrinking and institutions are exhibiting signs of academic inbreeding. Career advancement policies are perversely incentivized away from practical conservation research, thereby constraining capacity building. Comparative data indicate that China severely lags behind the United States and United Kingdom in research quality and capacity. We outline possible recommendations that include developing a different performance evaluation system, promoting training and international exchanges, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and fostering international collaborative networks for China-based conservation scientists. For global biodiversity governance, China must act to make up for considerable shortfalls in conservation research capacity and research collaborative networks. Recent institutional and vertebrate conservation scientists' publication data suggest that China has a growing conservation research capacity deficit. Here the authors outline steps China must take to build up this capacity in order to safeguard the country's exceptionally rich biodiversity.

In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Few researches have concentrated on the differences of biodiversity and eco-economic benefits between organic and conventional orchards. Organic management (OM) of orchards mainly includes taking advantage of natural enemies and beneficial weeds as well as soil organisms and controlling harmful pests. Here we conducted a three-year experiment on the effects of managing biodiversity in an organic apple orchard, using cattle manure to enrich soil biota, propagating native plant to suppress weeds and applying ecological pest management to control pests. The effect was assessed against the conventional management (CM) model. We found that OM enhanced soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. The 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results indicated that the dominant bacterial phyla of the top soil were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and OM had richer bacteria diversity with a7% higher Shannon's index than the CM. In particular, the relative abundance of rhizobium in the OM was higher than that of the CM. For OM, Duchesnea indica was an ideal groundcover plant to control weeds through winning the niche competition and thus decreased weeds' Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou index by 38.2%, 53.8% and 16.9% separately. The phototactic pests' weight and scarab beetle's population were effectively decreased by 35% and 86% respectively through long time control and prevention. OM had an average of 20 times more earthworms than CM, and the maximum density had reached 369 m 2 (0-20 cm soil). The dominant earthworm species of the OM were detritivores which preferring soil with high organic matter content. Due to no synthetic chemicals being used, the OM produced much safer apple fruits which were sold at high prices. Economically, up to a 103% increase of output-input ratio had been achieved in the OM. Our study clearly demonstrated that biodiversity management without chemical pollution increased the biodiversity of beneficial organisms, reduced antagonists of the fruit tree, and enhanced economic benefits of the apple orchard.

To test this, we assessed the relative importance of tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in young forest plantations tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging.	Haase, Josephine ; Castagneyrol, Bastien ; Cornelissen, J.

The South Orkney Islands (SOI), Scotia Arc, Southern Ocean. We sampled mega- and macro-benthos at the SOI using scuba in the shallows (0-10 m), a rough bottom otter trawl at 150-250 m and an Agassiz trawl and epibenthic sledge, both at depths of 200, 500, 1000 and 1500 m. We also collated species occurrence at the SOI in each realm from a century of literature and modern databases to investigate patterns in species accumulation, endemism, faunistic affinities and bathymetric ranges in three model taxa. Our 11 benthic samples showed that point biodiversity at the SOI is high, yielding 19 classes and 158 species. Nearly a third were new to the area, whilst five species and one genus were new to science. The shallowest samples were richest but had fewest new records of species. Known richness at the SOI is dominated by marine species (1026), of which 821 (83.3%) were benthic. Across all realms, 1224 species (50 classes, 24 phyla) were recorded, of which 43 were intertidal, 64 freshwater, 100 terrestrial, 60 parasitic and 40 birds. Species accumulation curves for model taxa showed new sampling yields about 0.75% per sample of known benthic richness, so by Antarctic standards we know the SOI quite well. Most species are Southern Ocean endemics, but very few occur only at the SOI. This first estimate of faunal biodiversity of a polar locality demonstrates both high richness and high levels of knowledge at the SOI. As suspected but never quantified, the benthos dominates polar biodiversity, at least at the SOI. Marine species there constitute 20% of those recently listed for the entire Southern Ocean, whilst > 60% of terrestrial species are known from Antarctica. The SOI, being one of the better-studied polar locations, of known age and with a discrete shelf, represent an important source of comparison for biodiversity studies. Our data clearly show that richness and our knowledge of the polar fauna differ across environments.	Barnes, David K.

Here we summarize work within the Swedish research program Abatement Strategies for Transboundary Air Pollution (ASTA) assessing the critical load of N for boreal forests. Results from both field experiments in an area with low background N deposition in northern Sweden, and from a large-scale monitoring study, show that important vegetational changes start to take place when adding low N doses and that recovery of the vegetation after ceasing N input is a very slow process. The data presented indicate that changes in key ecosystem components occur even at a lower rate of N input than the present recommended empirical critical load for boreal forest understorey vegetation of 10-15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Based on the data presented, we suggest that the critical load should be lowered to 6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1).

This study investigates the effects of experimental plant communities on different trophic levels in the soil food web of abandoned arable land. 2. In April 1996, a biodiversity experiment commenced using a continuation of agricultural crop rotation (CCR), spontaneous succession with naturally colonizing plant species (NC) and late-successional plant species sown in low-diversity (LD, four plant species) and high-diversity (HD, 15 plant species) communities. The nematode community was used as an indicator of the influence of the experimental plant communities on different trophic levels in the soil food web. 3. The nematode abundance in the experimental plant communities differed from that of the continued crop rotation, but there were hardly any differences between the natural, the low-diversity and the high-diversity plant communities. 4. The abundant plant-feeding nematodes and the somewhat less abundant bacterivorous nematodes were stimulated most by the sowing treatments. Fungivorous nematodes were stimulated less, while the numbers of omnivorous and carnivorous nematodes did not change significantly. 5. The diversity of the nematode community did not change over 2 years. 6. It is concluded that experimental plant communities have either small short-term effects or a delayed impact on the soil food web compared with the effect they have on above-ground invertebrate community development.

However, local extinction of species can occur with a temporal delay following habitat fragmentation, which is termed extinction debt. Many studies about extinction debt rely on community equilibrium from relationships between species richness and habitat variables. We assumed that the distribution of many vascular plant species in the coastal range of south-central Chile is not in equilibrium with the present habitat distribution. The aim of this research is to quantify patterns of habitat loss and to detect extinction debt from relationships between the current richness of different assemblages of vascular plants (considering longevity and habitat specialization) and both past and current habitat variables. The results showed that native forests have been fragmented and reduced by 53%, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.99%, in the study area between 1979 and 2011. Current richness of plant species was mostly explained by past habitat area and connectivity. Past habitat variables explained best richness of long-lived specialist plants, which are characterized by restricted habitat specialization and slower population turnover. We also showed that habitat fragmentation has resulted in a significant reduction in long-lived plant species' dwelling patch sizes (DPS) between 1979 and 2011. Our analyses provide the first evidence of predicted future losses of plant species in a South American temperate biodiversity hotspot. Consequently, an unknown proportion of the plants in the study area will become extinct if no targeted restoration and conservation action is taken in the near future.

Ecology and Evolution	04/01/2014	10.1002/ece3.1003	60	Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity, ecological functions, and ecosystem services. The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices.

UM variables are systematically mapped to the drivers of carbon, nitrogen, and biodiversity impacts. Change in mean species abundance is used as metric of biodiversity loss, by adopting the dose-response relationships from the GLOBIO model. The main biodiversity drivers related to UM included here are land-use change (LUC) and atmospheric N deposition. The methodology is demonstrated by studying the nexus for Shanghai in 2006, based on energy and soybean consumption. Results for Shanghai show a strong nexus between C, N, and biodiversity impact due to electricity consumption and energy used in manufacturing industries and construction. Prioritization of the shift away from coal energy will therefore lead to lowering the urban growth impact on all three dimensions. Road transportation, domestic aviation, and the metal industry impact only the C footprint highly, whereas district energy impacts only biodiversity loss highly, showing a weak nexus. Among the global impacts of soybean consumption in Shanghai on biodiversity loss (due to LUC only), the highest impact occurs in Uruguay (0.52%) followed by Brazil (0.05%) and Argentina (0.02%). The local impact on biodiversity loss (i.e., within China) of soybean consumption in Shanghai is 1.03%. However, the methodology and results are limited due to the partial inclusion of drivers, a carbon footprint based on carbon dioxide emissions only, and limitations of biodiversity loss models. Potential to overcome methodological limitations is discussed.

We conducted the first experimental test of the scale dependence of N effects on species richness from a 10-year N treatment (1.75-28gNm(-2)year(-1)) in a typical steppe. We used species-area relationship (SAR) to analyse the scale dependence of species loss with power model S=cA(z) (S is species number, A is area, c is intercept, and z is slope). Absolute species loss decreased at sampling area > 8m(2). Proportional species loss (compared to control) decreased and critical threshold (N-crit) for biodiversity losses increased with sampling areas. These scale dependences were quantified as increasing slope (z-value) of SAR with N addition. Through SAR decomposition, we found that this overall positive effect was in response to positive effects of changes to the species abundance distribution over negative effects of overall species richness losses.Synthesis. As nitrogen (N) enrichment typically occurs at scales much larger than individual plots, understanding how N enrichment affects the scaling patterns of biodiversity is necessary for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management in response to anthropogenic N deposition.

To reduce uncertainties in the conservation planning framework, we developed an adaptation index to assess the effect of topographic complexity on species adaptation to climate change, which was incorporated into the conservation framework as conservation costs. Meanwhile, the species distributions were predicted by the Maxent model, and the priority conservation areas were optimized during different periods in Sichuan province by the Marxan model. Our results showed that the effect of topographic complexity was critical for species adaptation, but the adaptation index decreased with the temperature increase. Based on the conservation targets and costs, the distributions of priority conservation areas were mainly concentrated in mountainous areas around the Sichuan Basin where may be robust to the adaptation to climate change. In the future, the distributions of priority conservation areas had no evident changes, accounting for about 26% and 28% of the study areas. Moreover, most species habitats could be conserved in terms of conservation targets in these priority conservation areas. Therefore, our approach could achieve biodiversity conservation goals and be highly practical. More importantly, quantifying the effect of topography also is critical for options for planning conservation areas in response to climate change.
